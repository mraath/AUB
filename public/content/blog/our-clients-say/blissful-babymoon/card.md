# Blissful Babymoon
## Our Clients Say
### Blissful Babymoon

We approached Liselle from Africa Unwind to help us plan a Babymoon in the winter months of South Africa.  Her recommendation did not disappoint. 
We had an absolute blast at Cederberg Ridge Wilderness Lodge, being treated as royalty from the moment we arrived.  We had the peacefulness of a fireplace in our suite and sipping on local tea from the area. 
Activities include a rock art excursion, a trip to a local wine estate and the most beautiful star gazing at night.  The heated pool at our suite also just rounded off the experience as we were able to get into our swimwear in the middle of winter and enjoy the most scenic views. 
We cannot thank Africa Unwind enough for planning this very special trip before we become parents!
