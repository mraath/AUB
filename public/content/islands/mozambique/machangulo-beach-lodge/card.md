### Machangulo Beach Lodge

#### Experience
The laid-back Machangulo Beach Lodge is set on a hillside in a private nature reserve on the southern Mozambican coastline, with the Indian Ocean on one side &amp; the calm estuaries of Maputo Bay on the other.
The untamed &amp; untouched Southern Mozambican coastline plays host to jaw-dropping ocean views, pristine beaches &amp; an abundance of marine life.
The resort is located around an hour’s boat ride from Maputo &amp; can also be reached by road on a scenic 4x4 transfer from the Kruger.
Excellent diving &amp; snorkelling can be enjoyed straight from the beach, or by boat &amp; guests can also explore some of the Indian Ocean’s best fishing sites.

#### Stay
Machangulo Beach Lodge boasts 5 ocean-view chalets, 2 beach villas &amp; 2 family villas that are connected by walkways &amp; staircases to the main buildings &amp; the beach.  
Each air-conditioned ocean-view chalet is perched high on a hillside &amp; features an en-suite bathroom &amp; private viewing deck with views of the Indian Ocean &amp; Inhaca Island.  These chalets are located a 2-minute walk from the beach down several stairs.
The beach villas are set a stone’s throw from the ocean’s edge &amp; consist of 2 en-suite bedrooms, separated by a large wooden deck with partial sea views.  
For families, the larger 2-bedroom family villa is ideal.  Both rooms have en-suite facilities that lead off from an open-plan living area with a lounge, bar, dining area &amp; kitchenette.  Outside on the deck, you will find a private plunge pool with jaw-dropping ocean views.
Communal areas include a lower deck with a plunge pool &amp; an upper deck with a beach bar, sunken lookout lounge &amp; restaurant where meals are served overlooking the ocean &amp; bay.
