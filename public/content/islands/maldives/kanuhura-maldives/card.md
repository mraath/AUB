#### Experience
Set on a private Maldivian island in the eastern Lhaviyani Atoll, Kanuhura Maldives is everything you have ever dreamt of.
After a 40-minute seaplane ride from Male International Airport - pristine beaches, turquoise waters &amp; palm trees await.
This luxurious island resort is surrounded by popular dive sites, so guests will have the opportunity to see a massive variety of incredible marine creatures in their natural habitat.  
It is not uncommon to see a pod of dolphins riding the waves or a manta ray glide through the water.

The beach villas are scattered along the white, sandy shores &amp; the water villas are built on stilts above the azure water of the Indian Ocean.

The resort features a water sports centre, a beautiful outdoor pool, 2 tennis courts, air-conditioned squash courts, a Kids Club &amp; a wellness spa that offers a range of relaxing treatments.
