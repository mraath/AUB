### Banyan Tree Vabbinfaru

#### Experience
Cast away on the secluded North Male Atoll in the beautiful Maldives archipelago, Banyan Tree Vabbinfaru is the ideal island paradise.  
After a 20-minute speedboat ride from Male International Airport, your dream island awaits.
Vabbinfaru in Maldivian means “round island circled by a round coral reef.”  As the name suggests, the resort offers world-class diving &amp; snorkelling year-round.
For those seeking absolute rest &amp; relaxation in a laid-back atmosphere, Banyan Tree is designed to deliver in luxurious fashion.  The beaches &amp; surrounding waters remain accessible only to in-house guests.

#### Stay
Encircled by a white powdery beach, 48 lavish villas are unique designed to reflect a seashell spiral.  Some of these are water villas &amp; some are beachside villas.
A tropical garden, outdoor terrace, private pool and jet pool, as well as a furnished timber deck, are classic features in every villa type.
The villas are similar in size (apart from the larger Vabbinfaru villa) with the main difference being in location.  The unusual open-air bathrooms are an identifiable Maldivian feature that is popular with guests.
Banyan Tree Vabbinfaru offers sublime dining choices ranging from eclectic Maldivian &amp; international cuisine at Ilaafathi to candlelit dinners under the stars.  Enjoy a private barbeque in the seclusion of your villa or experience a sandbank dinner of fresh seafood.

#### Activities
A wide range of activities can be enjoyed at Banyan Tree.  These include scuba diving, snorkelling, deep-sea fishing, night fishing, waterskiing, windsurfing &amp; catamaran sailing.
Guests can also enjoy canoeing, fun tubes, island hopping &amp; private yacht charters.
