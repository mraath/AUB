## ISLANDS
### Zanzibar

#### Experience
‘Unguja’, a name the locals use to describe the island of Zanzibar, is situated off the coast of Tanzania in East Africa. This Indian Ocean idyllic paradise is perfect for island-lovers who enjoy beautiful beaches &amp; a wide range of activities.
Upon arrival, most guests prefer to stop over in the historic Stone Town where rich culture, colourful markets &amp; the smell of spices fill the air. Photographers love exploring this old town, where fallen-apart buildings &amp; colourful washing lines brighten up the streets.
Children ride past on bicycles &amp; locals go about their daily business while tourists pose for pictures in front of old hand-crafted doors, famous for Zanzibar architecture.
Luxurious beach resorts are scattered throughout the island overlooking white, powder-soft beaches with beautiful palm trees. Here, guests can enjoy a wide range of activities – including excellent diving &amp; snorkelling as well as romantic sunset dhow cruises &amp; dolphin expeditions.
Other activities include day trips to see the giant turtles on Changuu Island or going on exotic Spice Tours – one of the most popular activities on this ‘Island of Spices.’
Guests looking for a more exclusive island holiday should opt to stay at one of Zanzibar’s private islands – Pemba Island or Mnemba Island.
Zanzibar combines easily with Tanzania’s safari regions, making this an ideal post-safari island destination.

#### Stay
Accommodation in Zanzibar tends to be a blend between the relaxed &amp; the exotic. Guests can choose between luxury beach resorts on the Zanzibar island, private villas, boutique-style lodges &amp; family-friendly options.
The private islands are ideal for honeymooners or romantics looking for a tranquil holiday escape.

#### When to travel
The best time to visit Zanzibar is between June &amp; October when it is warm &amp; balmy, and then again in the popular dry season between December &amp; February. Zanzibar experiences a wet season, around March, April &amp; May, these are not the ideal months to visit Zanzibar.
