Designed with romance in mind, the en-suite bathrooms are partially open to the bedrooms.

Stonetown has a variety of fun-filled activities on the to-do list.  
Guests can enjoy exotic spice tours, explore the streets of Stone Town with a local guide, see giant tortoises on Prison Island, sample the street food at a local market or visit Freddy Mercury’s house.
They can also try their hand at coffee roasting, embark on a traditional dhow cruise, visit Jozani Forest or enjoy a rooftop dinner at Emerson on Hurumzi while watching the sun go down.
