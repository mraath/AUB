### Mnemba Island Lodge

#### Experience
Mnemba Island is a tropical paradise of coral reefs, powdery beaches &amp; turquoise water found just off the coast of Zanzibar - &amp; just 1,5km in circumference.   
Lying on this dreamy isle is Mnemba Island Lodge – a small &amp; intimate boutique-style beach resort with a dedication to providing only the best in barefoot luxury.
The resort is home to a PADI dive school &amp; 2 dive boats, allowing guests to venture to the ocean when they want.  Complimentary non-motorized water sports like kayaking &amp; windsurfing are available to Mnemba Island guests &amp; the permanent beach is ideal for swimming.
The island is also home to a fascinating green turtle population that can be seen between April &amp; August each year.  Shoes are not necessary on the island, so enjoy the laid-back island atmosphere with no dress code…&amp; no shoes!

#### Stay
The resort is small &amp; intimate, consisting of only 10 thatched beach bandas that are tucked into a tropical forest.  Two of these bandas are situated within close proximity to one another &amp; can accommodate a family of four.  
Footsteps away – you will find the beach &amp; crystal-clear ocean with warm water, great visibility &amp; around 430 species of fish, including the treasured whale shark.
Each beach banda boasts a covered walkway leading to a shuttered en-suite bathroom.  There are built-in barazas on the veranda – a great spot for afternoon siestas &amp; private beach salas with traditional Zanzibari loungers for lazy beach days.
In the main area, you will find a restaurant, bar &amp; Kids Club.

#### Activities
Activities at Mnemba Island Lodge include snorkelling, diving, fishing, kayaking, stand-up paddleboarding, windsurfing &amp; deep-sea fishing.  
Guests can also enjoy relaxing spa treatments, book a private dinner on the beach with a butler or send little ones to the Kids Club for some island adventures.
