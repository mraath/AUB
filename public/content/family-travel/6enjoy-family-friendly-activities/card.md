ENJOY FAMILY-FRIENDLY ACTIVITIES
There are certain countries in the world that, as parents, we simply won’t dare to visit with our kids.  They are simply not child-friendly.
Fortunately, Africa is the ‘Fun Aunt’ when it comes to family-friendly activities, so rest assured: Mum, Dad &amp; the little ones will have a blast!
Africa offers you the chance to spot a lion in the wild, ride on the back of an elephant, zipline through a forest, quad bike in the desert &amp; go on treasure hunt adventures.  If you can think of it, you’ll probably be able to do it:  helicopter flights, hot air balloon safaris, sunset boat cruises, snorkelling, stand-up paddleboarding, scuba diving, canoe safaris, guided walks, stargazing….the list is endless.  There is also bungee jumping, animal encounters, treehouse sleep-outs &amp; Kids Clubs.
Since each lodge, camp or resort offers its own list of exciting activities, why not browse through a few of them &amp; see for yourself?  Or – even better – ask one of our African Safari Experts to help you plan your dream holiday.  That’s why we are here!
We are happy to custom design a holiday that will suit your family’s needs &amp; requirements, so send us an enquiry &amp; we’ll get back to you with some exciting suggestions.
Whatever your family wants to do, we can probably make it happen!  
Because it is challenging to put together a list of all the activities Africa has to offer, we thought we’ll direct you to the very beginning.
What kind of holiday will be ideal for your family?  A safari?  An island getaway?  Or a city break? (Or all of the above?)
1. Safaris
Perhaps everyone on Planet Earth has dreamed of going on safari to Africa!  The word safari means “journey” &amp; visiting the real Africa is a unique experience.  Getting up close &amp; personal with some of the world’s most impressive &amp; endangered animals, sleeping in luxury tents &amp; learning more about the fascinating African culture is what a safari holiday is all about!
2. Islands
Life is busy.  So, let’s be honest – all of us deserve some pampering every now &amp; again.  For some – pampering means strolling on white, sandy beaches with crystal clear water, while others enjoy eating fresh seafood or sipping on a cocktail while watching the sunset.  There are those who prefer lying in a hammock or getting a relaxing massage while others want to dive, snorkel &amp; explore the island through adventure activities.  Whichever way you choose to relax, an island will get you there!
3. Cities
While many people love to get away from the hustle &amp; bustle of city life while on holiday, they often realize that visiting a city in another part of the world can be just as relaxing as a safari or a beach holiday.  You don’t have to worry about meals, because everything is available around the clock – from high-end restaurants &amp; cafes to cocktail bars &amp; markets.  Besides, you get to explore, see new places, experience new cultures, indulge in adventure activities &amp; also tick off your bucket list.
