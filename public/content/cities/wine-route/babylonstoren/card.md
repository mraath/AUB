### Babylonstoren

#### Experience
Babylonstoren is everything but ordinary.  One of the oldest Cape Dutch farms, this elegant home offers a simplistic, yet luxurious farm-style experience.  
So much more than just a farm, Babylonstoren loves to provide their guests with a personal, authentic – yet luxurious stay by allowing guests to get involved in some exciting farm activities, like fruit picking in season or tasting food prepared fresh from their garden.
In fact, here guests can experience the Winelands’ best farm-to-table kitchen concept in a relaxed, farm-style setting.
Ideal for couples, honeymooners or families, Babylonstoren offers a little something for everyone.  The farm dam &amp; restored reservoir are ideal swimming spots in summer &amp; guests can even cycle through the vineyards or simply take a stroll through the beautiful Babylonstoren gardens.

#### Stay
Small &amp; intimate, Babylonstoren only consists of 22 cottages &amp; suites to ensure a private, exclusive stay.  There are 6 one-bedroom suites, 3 one-bedroom cottages, 4 two-bedroom cottages &amp; 9 farmhouse suites. 
The suites &amp; cottages are built in traditional Cape Dutch style, with white-washed walls, thatched roofs &amp; clean, contemporary interiors.  High ceilings, white decor &amp; hand-picked furniture give the rooms a modern feel while maintaining the historical flair.
The tea garden provides delicious lunches, while the renowned Babel restaurant remains a favourite for its interesting food combinations.  Other areas include a gym, library, bar, wellness spa &amp; swimming pool.

#### Activities
Babylonstoren’s garden is where the magic happens.  Guests can enjoy guided tours of this floral wonderland or get involved in harvesting fruit or picking the vines.  Other exciting activities include rowing at the dam, winetasting &amp; cellar tours, hiking, swimming, fishing &amp; cycling.
Kids will have a blast!  They can feed the donkeys, collect eggs, help harvest fruit &amp; vegetables, go on scavenger hunts &amp; even assist the chef in kneading &amp; baking delicious farm bread.
