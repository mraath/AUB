### Victoria Falls River Lodge

#### Experience
Overlooking the mighty Zambezi River, Victoria Falls River Lodge was Zambezi National Park’s very first private game lodge.  
Its amazing location – so close to the majestic Victoria Falls – offers guests the unique opportunity to see the spray of the Falls in the distance!
With uninterrupted views &amp; an idyllic riverside setting, Victoria Falls River Lodge never fails to impress.  Besides excellent wildlife viewing, luxurious accommodation &amp; fine dining, guests will have quick access to one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World &amp; all its adventure activities.

#### Stay
Victoria Falls River Lodge boasts 13 luxury tented suites (of which 5 are family units), 6 island treehouse suites, set apart on a private island as well as 2 star bed treehouses raised on a rooftop deck.
Each of the luxury thatched tented suites is constructed of canvas, glass &amp; timber &amp; extends out onto a private deck with its own splash pool.  Here, guests can enjoy uninterrupted views of the Zambezi River &amp; natural bush.  
Family tents are similar, but also include an adjoining room with either a single &amp; a bunk bed or twin beds.
The island treehouse suites, as the name suggests, are set on a private island &amp; are ideal for guests looking for a highly exclusive experience (aged 16 years &amp; older) while each of the double-storey star bed treehouses features an open-air rooftop deck with a sitting area &amp; a signature star bed suspended above the treetops. 
The main lodge boasts a swimming pool &amp; an open-plan dining &amp; sitting area that offers sensational views of the Zambezi.
