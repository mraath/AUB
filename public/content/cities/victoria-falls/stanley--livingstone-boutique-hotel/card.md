### Stanley & Livingstone Boutique Hotel

#### Experience
The Stanley &amp; Livingstone is a small boutique hotel with only 16 suites set in a 6 000-acre private game reserve about 10km from Victoria Falls on the Zimbabwean side.
A safari hotel in Victorian style reflects the old-world charm of that bygone era.  
This stylish &amp; elegant boutique hotel offers luxurious accommodation &amp; exciting activities combined with superb service &amp; culinary cuisine.

#### Stay
Accommodation at The Stanley &amp; Livingstone comprises 16 air-conditioned luxurious suites.  Each suite offers an en-suite Victorian-style bathroom with walk-in shower &amp; slipper bath as well as a lounge area &amp; private veranda.
Other hotel facilities include a dining room, lounge, bar, Kids Club &amp; swimming pool with spectacular views over the waterhole.  Guests can laze around at the pool or enjoy cocktails within full view of the surrounding wildlife.
There is also a sundeck terrace that is used for al fresco dining under the stars.

#### Activities
There are plenty of activities to enjoy at The Stanley &amp; Livingstone.  
Some of these include helicopter flights over the Falls, white water river rafting or canoeing on the mighty Zambezi River, swimming at Devil’s Pool, lunch at Livingstone island, sunset boat cruises, bungee jumping, elephant interactions &amp; much more!
Another favorite is to simply relax with a sundowner in hand as the sun sets over the local waterhole where elephants, kudu &amp; other game come to drink.
