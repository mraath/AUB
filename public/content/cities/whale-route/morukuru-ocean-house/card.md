### Morukuru Ocean House

#### Experience
Boasting a secluded setting in the pristine De Hoop Nature Reserve, Morukuru Ocean House is an exclusive-use beach villa that offers an unspoilt, private &amp; luxurious stay.
The area is renowned for its excellent land-based whale watching, but against the backdrop of flower-filled fynbos vegetation &amp; distant purple mountains, De Hoop is also home to other animals like baboons, ostriches &amp; eland as well as dolphins, tortoises &amp; sea birds.
Easily reached via self-drive, Morukuru Ocean House lies less than a 4-hour drive from Cape Town or the Winelands, which makes this an ideal stop on a Cape Town to Garden Route self-drive itinerary.
