### 1Experience Africa In Luxury

EXPERIENCE AFRICA IN LUXURY
Luxury is the key ingredient when planning a honeymoon.  Getting married is a big deal &amp; celebrating such a special occasion should be done in style.
Beautiful views, exclusivity, private plunge pools &amp; outdoor showers are perhaps some of the things that made their way onto your Honeymoon List – &amp; rightly so – but there are also other things to consider when choosing the ultimate honeymoon destination.
See, luxury is not just about ‘things,’ it is also about experiences.  Sometimes luxury can be seen in exclusive private villas &amp; other times it is found in beautiful, tented camps.  But more importantly – luxury can also be enjoyed on a scenic hot air balloon flight, during a relaxing couples’ massage or by spending the night in a remote treehouse under a canopy of stars!
Luxury comes in different shapes &amp; sizes, but one thing is certain – on honeymoon, you should have plenty of it!
There are so many romantic lodges &amp; resorts to choose from, so our list will barely scratch the surface, but at least it’s a start.  So join us as we celebrate our Safari Favourites in Luxury.
