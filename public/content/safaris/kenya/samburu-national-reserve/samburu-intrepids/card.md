Set in a picturesque mountainous landscape on the banks of the Ewaso Nyiro River in Samburu National Reserve, lies Samburu Intrepid, a classic tented camp with comfortable accommodation &amp; exciting safari activities.
The camp is a wonderful choice for families since their Kids Club is one of the best in the region, offering a range of fun-filled bush activities for the little ones.  The Adventurer’s Club focus on children &amp; The Young Rangers’ Club is for slightly older teenagers.
For an adventurous break from the hustle &amp; bustle, overnight fly-camping excursions in small dome tents are available on request.

#### Stay
Accommodation at Samburu Intrepids consists of 28 luxury tents with private views over the game-rich banks of the Ewaso Nyiro River.
Each en-suite tent is built on a raised deck overlooking the brown river where elephants often make an appearance, or the crocodiles come out to lounge by the river’s banks.
The central lodge features a relaxing lounge &amp; dining area with a bar, Kids Club &amp; a swimming pool where lazy days are often spent.
