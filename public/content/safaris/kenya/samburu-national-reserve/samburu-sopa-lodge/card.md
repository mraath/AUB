### Samburu Sopa Lodge

#### Experience
Set on a hilltop inside the Samburu National Reserve, Samburu Sopa Lodge boasts jaw-dropping views over Mount Kenya &amp; the distant Samburu Plains.
The architecture reflects a similar style to the local Samburu housing &amp; therefore blends in seamlessly with the environment.
  
The camp boasts awe-inspiring views over a busy waterhole where animals are often seen drinking or playing, allowing excellent armchair game viewing from the comfort of the lodge’s viewing deck.

#### Stay
There are 30 cottages at Samburu Sopa Lodge that have been built to form a buffalo-horn pattern, converging at the public areas to allow the resident wildlife to access the waterhole at its open end.
Each high-ceiling cottage features 2 tastefully appointed bedrooms with an en-suite bathroom &amp; a private veranda.  
The lodge’s main facilities include a comfortable lounge, bar, restaurant, outdoor dining area &amp; sparkling swimming pool.
