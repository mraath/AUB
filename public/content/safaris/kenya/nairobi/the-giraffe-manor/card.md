### The Giraffe Manor

#### Experience
Offering an experience like no other, the charming Giraffe Manor is set within 140 acres of indigenous forest in Karen, an upscale neighbourhood in Nairobi.
Yes, that photo you have seen so many times on Instagram where guests are hand-feeding a giraffe that is peeking its head through a window – happens here daily.
Guests can find friendly giraffes in the most interesting places, like at the breakfast table, or your room window. (if you have one of the front rooms)  
Now animal lovers can tick giraffe interactions off their bucket list.

#### Stay
Giraffe House has 2 wings – Manor House that was built in 1932 &amp; Garden Manor that was added in 2011.    
Each has 5 superior rooms &amp; 1 suite, bringing the total number of rooms to 10 superior rooms &amp; 2 suites.
All rooms have beautiful en-suite bathrooms &amp; private verandas, whereas the suites come complete with living &amp; lounge spaces as well as a second sleeping area (second bedroom or loft) for children.
The main area features a sitting room – ideal for tea-time, with large windows so guests can enjoy beautiful views of the giraffes &amp; the surrounding sanctuary.  
The sunroom is where breakfast is served – to guests &amp; to giraffes who love to poke their long necks through the enormous windows to see what’s on your plate.

#### Activities
A variety of exciting activities are available at Giraffe Manor.
These include breakfast or afternoon tea with the giraffes, lawn games, chess, spa treatments, or spending time at the on-site Orchid House.
