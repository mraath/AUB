### Nairobi Tented Camp

#### Experience
Nairobi Tented Camp enjoys an ideal setting within the Nairobi National Park â€“ an authentic big game reserve on the outskirts of the city.  
Tucked away in a riverine forest, this charming, tented camp is a great introduction to a Kenya safari.  
Nairobi Tented Camp is an ideal choice for guests who need to stop over in Nairobi before or after a Kenya safari, but still prefer to get away from the hustle &amp; bustle of city life.
The park is home to over 100 mammal species - including rhino (a rare sighting in the Mara) as well as buffalo, giraffe, lion, leopard, baboon, zebra, wildebeest &amp; cheetah.  Bird enthusiasts can spot over 400 migratory &amp; endemic birds here.

#### Stay
The camp consists of 9 luxury tents, all equipped with en-suite facilities.  Each en-suite bathroom features a hot bucket shower, basin &amp; toilet.
Each spacious tent has an exclusive, yet friendly feel.  Tastefully furnished with local material, the tents have private verandas offering beautiful views over the bush.
The central mess tent houses the bar, dining &amp; lounge facilities.

#### Activities
Activities at Nairobi Tented Camp include open 4x4 game drives, guided walks as well as city tours to see the Sheldrick Elephant Orphanage, Giraffe Centre &amp; Karen Blixen Museum.
