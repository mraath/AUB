#### Experience
Nairobi, Kenya’s capital, is bigger than Johannesburg &amp after decades of regular international flights, have become the unrivalled gateway to East Africa.
As you venture into this vibrant city, you'll discover that Nairobi is more than just a layover destination. It's an ideal place to recover from jetlag before embarking on your Kenyan safari. Whether you need an overnight stay for a connecting flight or wish to explore the city's treasures, Nairobi offers a wide array of accommodation options.
From towering skyscraper hotels to charming boutique accommodations and safari-style lodges nestled on the edge of Nairobi National Park, there's a lodging choice for every traveler. One standout gem is the family-favorite Giraffe Manor, a unique and endearing experience. And for culinary enthusiasts, the world-renowned Carnivore Restaurant beckons with some of the finest steak dinners on the planet.
Nairobi boasts not one but two airports: Nairobi Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, where international flights touch down, &amp Wilson Airport, just a 30-minute drive away. Wilson Airport caters to travelers seeking flights on smaller aircraft to Kenya's renowned wildlife reserves, setting the stage for your grand safari adventure.

#### Activities
Beyond indulging in sumptuous steak dinners at Carnivore Restaurant, Nairobi teems with exciting attractions &amp activities. Dive into the rich history of the region with a visit to the Karen Blixen Museum, celebrating the author of "Out of Africa."

For a quick safari fix, Nairobi National Park is a stone's throw away, offering a tantalizing taste of Kenya's iconic wildlife. Here, you can embark on a thrilling Nairobi National Park safari tour, catching glimpses of African creatures against the backdrop of the city skyline.

#### When to travel
