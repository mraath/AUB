The conservancy belongs to the local Maasai community who have recently set aside the area as a sanctuary for wildlife, resulting in an abundance of game – putting Porini Mara on the map as a sought-after safari destination.
Porini Mara Camp offers a traditional safari experience in luxury tents as well as a range of exciting wildlife activities.

There is also a main tent with a communal dining area &amp; a cosy lounge.
