### Saruni Mara

#### Experience
Ideally positioned in a private conservancy bordering the Masai Mara National Reserve in Kenya, lies Saruni Mara, a luxury tented camp &amp; an ideal base from which to explore the iconic Great Wildebeest Migration.
Being only 1 of 10 lodges in this 74,000-acre conservancy, Saruni Mara offers guests an exclusive &amp; private safari experience – away from crowds!
Out of season, the area is still teeming with wildlife - especially the Big 5 – so Saruni Mara can happily play host throughout the year.

#### Stay
Saruni Mara is the only small boutique lodge in the Mara &amp; features only 5 elegant cottages, 1 family villa &amp; 1 private villa, ensuring an intimate &amp; exclusive safari experience.
Set on rolling hills, each en-suite cottage boasts an open veranda with breathtaking views over the distant Mara plains.
The family villa consists of 2 en-suite bedrooms, a spacious lounge &amp; dining area as well as an impressive veranda overlooking the magnificent scenery of the Masai Mara.
The private villa is a luxurious wilderness retreat, built with absolute privacy in mind.  The villa comprises 2 en-suite bedrooms, a lounge &amp; dining room as well as a kitchen &amp; large veranda with front garden.  This villa is booked exclusively &amp; is a 5-minute drive away from Saruni Mara.  Guests staying here will have a private safari vehicle &amp; guide &amp; enjoy the privilege of private dining.
Shared areas at Saruni Mara include a dining space, spa, bar, lounge, library &amp; Kids Club.

#### Activities
Activities include day &amp; night drives, guided walking safaris, bush meals, spa treatments, bird watching &amp; cultural visits to Maasai villages.
