## Masai Mara
### Naibor Camp

#### Experience
Naibor Camp boasts a remarkable location on the banks of the Talek River deep in the heart of one of Kenya’s World Heritage Sites – the iconic Masai Mara.
The camp’s strategic setting close to major crossing points over the Mara River makes this an ideal spot to witness millions of animals move through the area during the annual Wildebeest Migration.
Contemporary in style, yet uniquely traditional – the way a safari camp should be – Naibor Camp is a wonderful choice for couples or honeymooners who are looking for an authentic wilderness experience.

#### Stay
Positioned among the trees, 7 safari-style canvas tents offer beautiful views &amp; complete privacy.  
Each tent features an en-suite bathroom &amp; opens out onto a private, shaded veranda with awe-inspiring bush views.
The main mess tent’s one section comprises a relaxation zone with floor-cushions, rugs &amp; sofas as well as a small library &amp; bar area, creating an inviting &amp; comfortable space.
In another tent further away, you will find Naibor Spa – a quiet &amp; secluded haven that offers a variety of relaxing spa treatments.

#### Activities
Activities at Naibor Camp include open 4x4 game drives, hot air balloon safaris over the vast Kenyan plains as well as al fresco meals &amp; sundowners in the bush.
