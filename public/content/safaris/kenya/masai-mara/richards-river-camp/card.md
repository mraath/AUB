## Masai Mara
### Richard's River Camp

#### Experience
Richard’s River Camp - as the name suggests – enjoys a beautiful setting on the banks of the Njageteck River in the exclusive Mara North Conservancy in Kenya’s Masai Mara.
Here, guests can witness the iconic Wildebeest Migration where vast numbers of wildebeest, zebra &amp; other antelope move in an annual pattern - which is fairly predictable - between the Serengeti &amp; the Masai Mara.
The area is home to an abundance of wildlife &amp; offers reliable big cat sightings year-round.

#### Stay
Richard’s Camp is small &amp; intimate, boasting only 5 luxury safari tents (including a 2-bedroom family tent) – an ideal choice for families or friends who are looking for a private &amp; secluded safari experience.  
Clients who would like to make an exclusive use booking will have the entire camp to themselves!
Each tent is spacious &amp; beautifully furnished in a comfortable safari style.  Raised on concrete platforms, the tents boast en-suite bathrooms &amp; private decks overlooking the bush.  The dressing area can comfortably fit 2 extra beds, so families of 4 can be accommodated.
The family tent consists of 2 luxury inter-connected tents, with a central living area in the middle.  There is a portion that can be drawn down between the 2 sleeping units for privacy.  These dressing rooms can also accommodate 2 extra beds each should it be required, so the family tent can comfortably sleep up to 8 people.
The communal area at Richard’s Camp features a lounge, dining space &amp; library.

#### Activities
Safari activities at Richard’s Camp are ample!
They include day &amp; night game drives in open 4x4 vehicles, guided walks within Mara North, cultural visits to a Masai village, bush picnics, sundowner excursions, hot air balloon safaris &amp; visits to the National Reserve for stays of 3 nights or longer.
