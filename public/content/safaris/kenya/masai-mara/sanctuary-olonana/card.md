### Sanctuary Olonana

#### Experience
Sanctuary Olonana boasts an idyllic forest setting along a private stretch of the Mara River, adjacent to the Masai Mara National Reserve in Kenya.
This luxurious &amp; intimate safari lodge provides guests with easy access to the iconic Wildebeest Migration between July &amp; October - the greatest spectacle on Earth!
Millions of wildebeest, zebra &amp; other antelope migrate between the Serengeti &amp; Masai Mara, so Olonana guests can encounter treacherous river crossings &amp; numerous predators on their endless journey to new grazing.
Outside of the Migration season, the reserve is home to an abundance of wildlife, including the Big 5, so Olonana guests have the privilege of enjoying a first-class safari experience in &amp; out of season.

#### Stay
Sanctuary Olonana boasts 14 opulent safari suites, at least 130 sqm in size, with floor-to-ceiling glass doors that open out to reveal the magnificent Mara River.  Three of the suites are ideal for families as they feature an extra bedroom.
Each suite features a lavish en-suite bathroom with bathtub, double vanity &amp; rain shower as well as an inviting deck with a day bed offering panoramic vistas of the Mara – an ideal spot to relax post-safari.
Olonana’s large main building houses a lounge, bar, library, dining area with fireplace as well as a large terrace overlooking the river.

#### Activities
Sanctuary Olonana includes a wide range of exciting activities, such as game drives, guided walking safaris, visits to local Maasai communities &amp; thrilling hot air balloon safaris.
Relaxing spa treatments can also be booked.
