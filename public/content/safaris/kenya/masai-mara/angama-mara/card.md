### Angama Mara

#### Experience
Angama Mara has it all – a spectacular setting, glorious views &amp; luxurious interiors.  Located high above the floor of Africa’s Great Rift Valley, this owner-run safari lodge overlooks Kenya’s Masai Mara &amp; is considered by many as one of the best game reserves on the continent.
With an unbeatable location in the Mara Triangle, close to the Wildebeest Migration’s river crossing hotspot, it is not surprising that guests return to this piece of paradise year upon year.
The views are simply magnificent!  Guests can sip on a sundowner while watching hot air balloons drift by or enjoy their delicious garden-to-table cuisine, proudly prepared by an Angama chef.

#### Stay
The Swahili word ‘angama’ means ‘to be suspended in mid-air’ – a fitting name, as the lodge comprises 2 intimate camps of just 15 tented suites each that seems to hang on the edge of the Rift Valley.
Four of these are inter-connecting tents, which allow children of 6 years &amp; older to move safely between their tent &amp; their parents.
Each eco-friendly tented suite boasts an en-suite bathroom &amp; wooden deck with endless views over the bush.  
Angama Mara’s main area consists of a large dining deck with a swimming pool, fitness centre, photographic studio, library, spa &amp; boma area where most evenings are spent around a sizzling fire.

#### Activities
There are plenty of fun-filled safari activities available at Angama Mara.
These include game drives, hot air balloon safaris, walking with Maasai warriors, photography, visits to the shamba – the one-acre kitchen garden, picnics, sundowners in the Maasai Boma, bush barbeques, visits to the Beading Studio, bush jogs with a Kenyan &amp; visits to the Maasai Manyatta.
