### Kulala Desert Lodge

#### Experience
Kulala Desert Lodge is located within the arid Namib Desert on a 37,000-hectare private reserve, closest to the iconic red sand dunes of Sossusvlei.
This region is probably the most popular destination in Namibia.  Red sand dunes, hot-air balloon safaris, beautiful landscapes &amp; excellent photographic opportunities all contribute to Sossusvlei’s claim to fame.

#### Stay
Kulala Desert Lodge’s accommodation comprises 23 thatched &amp; canvas tents.
Two of these units are family tents which can accommodate 2 adults &amp; 2 children.  Each tent is equipped with an en-suite bathroom &amp; private verandah.  
Each tent is built on a wooden platform &amp; has a deck on the flat rooftop where bedrolls are placed for guests to sleep under the starry skies.  
Kulala Desert Lodge has a main area with a lounge, bar, dining room, plunge pool &amp; wrap-around verandah overlooking the waterhole.  An abundance of wildlife can be found here daily, quenching their thirst.

#### Activities
Early morning nature drives to the spectacular sand dunes of Sossusvlei are always the highlight of any stay.  
Guided walks, electric fat bike trips, sundowner drives, quad biking or thrilling hot-air balloon safaris over the dunes can also be enjoyed.  
The balloon safari offers a unique safari experience, with a champagne breakfast being served at your landing site.
Star bed sleep-outs should be added to everyone’s bucket list!  And trips to Dead Vlei &amp; Sesriem Canyon are also popular activities.
