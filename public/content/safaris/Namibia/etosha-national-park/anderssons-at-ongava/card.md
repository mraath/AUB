### Andersson's At Ongava

#### Experience
Andersson’s at Ongava is located in one of Africa’s largest game reserves – the Etosha National Park in Northern Namibia.  
This family-friendly camp offers sensational waterhole game viewing, with frequent sightings of the famous white &amp; black rhino, amongst a variety of other game.

#### Stay
Set against the backdrop of a spectacular mountain range, Andersson’s offers breathtaking views over the reserve.  
There are 6 standard suites &amp; 1 family unit, built from a combination of wood &amp; stone in keeping with Etosha’s natural surroundings.  All have en-suite facilities &amp; private viewing decks with 180-degree panoramic views.
Each suite has a double-door entrance &amp; a small verandah offering privacy &amp; seclusion.  The family unit comprises 2 suites connected by a raised boardwalk.

#### Activities
Etosha National Park is Namibia’s premier wildlife destination.  At almost the size of Switzerland, it is certainly one of Africa’s largest parks.  
Professional rangers will take you on guided game drives in search of wildlife &amp; walking safaris are also in high demand.
The hide overlooking the camp’s waterhole is a popular spot for photographers &amp; other wildlife enthusiasts.
Large herds of plains game concentrate around the waterholes in the dry season, whilst the summer season’s sporadic rainfall allows for excellent sightings of new life, from baby springbok to young wildebeest.
