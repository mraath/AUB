### Mushara Outpost

#### Experience
Mushara Outpost is located just 10km from the Von Lindequist Gate on the eastern boundary of Etosha National Park in northern Namibia.  
An ideal base for visitors to the reserve, Mushara Outpost is a luxurious tented camp that is loved by honeymooners or couples looking for peace &amp; tranquillity.  The camp does not allow children under the age of 12.
The name Mushara is derived from the Purple Pod Terminalia tree which grows abundantly on the lodge grounds &amp; in the surroundings.

#### Stay
Mushara Outpost consists of 8 custom-designed wood &amp; canvas tents, each with an en-suite bathroom.
All tents are nestled on the banks of a dry riverbed &amp; mounted on a wooden deck 1.5 m above the ground, providing unobstructed views of the bush.  
The lodgeâ€™s main area is styled like an old farmhouse with high walls, a corrugated iron roof &amp; a large wrap-around verandah facing northeast to take advantage of the shade. 
 With a friendly ambience &amp; personalized service, guests will feel right at home.

#### Activities
Guided game drives are led by experienced rangers.  The vehicles are spacious &amp; offer 360-degree views from the elevated seats.  
Etosha is home to a variety of game, including the elusive black rhino.
