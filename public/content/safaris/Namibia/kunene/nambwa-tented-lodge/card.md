### Nambwa Tented Lodge

#### Experience
Nambwa Tented Lodge is a Namibian safari escape set in a canopy of trees inside the Bwabwata National Park in the heart of the Kavango Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area (KAZA) – Africa’s largest conservation area.
This protected area spans 109 million acres, almost three-quarters the size of Texas &amp; combines 36 individual nature preserves &amp; the land around them.
Here at KAZA, you will find 44 per cent of Africa’s elephants, 600 plant species &amp; 3,000 species of birds.
Guests visiting Nambwa Tented Lodge should know that elephants have right of way around camp!  Nambwa has been unobtrusively built on lengthy timber walkways above these large mammals’ migratory route, so guests will have ‘front row’ seats to the bush parade.

#### Stay
There are 10 tented suites at Nambwa, each comprising an en-suite bathroom with bathtub &amp; shower, a cosy lounge &amp; a private spacious deck offering marvellous views over the bush.
Guests can lift their canvas walls to remove any separation from the bush or soak in a bubble bath while listening to the sounds of nature.
The central area includes a lounge, dining room, bar, library &amp; pool.

#### Activities
Nambwa Tented Camp offers a wide range of safari activities – in fact, more than most in Namibia!  
These include open 4x4 game drives, night drives, walking safaris with a qualified tracker, boat cruises on the river &amp; village visits to local communities.
Other options to consider are having a bush breakfast on a private island, romantic sundowners in the bush or wilderness picnics.
