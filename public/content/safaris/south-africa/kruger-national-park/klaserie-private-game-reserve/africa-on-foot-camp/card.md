# Africa on Foot Camp
## Klaserie Private Game Reserve
### Africa on Foot Camp

#### Experience
Africa on Foot Camp is an authentic safari camp located in the Klaserie Private Game Reserve, adjacent to the Kruger National Park &amp; home to Africa’s Big 5.
Guides &amp; trackers at Africa on Foot are extremely passionate about the bush &amp; will do their utmost best to ensure their guests have a wonderful safari experience.  Although the camp offers exciting game drives, the real highlight &amp; focus here is their walking safaris.

#### Stay
With only 5 safari chalets, Africa on Foot Camp allows guests an intimate safari experience.  The focus here is not so much on silver service, slippers &amp; bathrobes – but on good quality game viewing, warm hospitality &amp; comfort.  
Three of the 5 en-suite chalets are designed to sleep 2 people each &amp; the other 2 en-suite chalets are ideal for families, as they are subdivided into 2 rooms so that the entire family can be together.
The main camp features a lounge area with comfortable couches, a dining room, a traditional African boma &amp; a swimming pool with magnificent views over the bushveld.

#### Activities
At Africa on Foot, the focus is on exciting walking safaris as well as game drives.  Usually, guests depart on a walking safari in the early morning &amp; enjoy a game drive in the afternoon so that they can experience the best of both worlds.
One of the highlights of staying at Africa on Foot is sleeping in the treehouse that is located on the outskirts of the camp.  This is at an additional cost, but it is well worth the adventure!  Guests can request a romantic dinner set-up for 2 when spending the night there.
The Bush Bar is located away from camp in the middle of the bush &amp; is ideal for special events, celebratory sundowners &amp; marked occasions like Christmas canapes or proposals.
Guests can also book The Romantic Honeymooner Sundowner Experience at an additional cost, but for honeymooners this package is complimentary.
