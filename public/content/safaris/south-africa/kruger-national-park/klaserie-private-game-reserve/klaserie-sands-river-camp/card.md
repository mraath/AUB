### Klaserie Sands River Camp

#### Experience
Klaserie Sands River Camp is a luxury, intimate safari camp located along the dry Nâ€™tsiri riverbed in the wildlife-rich Klaserie Private Nature Reserve, adjacent to the Kruger National Park.  
Since the Klaserie shares an unfenced border with the Kruger, game is moving freely throughout the region, so guests can expect superb Big 5 wildlife viewing in a private reserve setting, away from the masses.
The lodge is small &amp; intimate, allowing only 8 guests in camp at a time, which means that a large family or groups of friends travelling together can book the entire lodge exclusively, enjoying a private safari experience.

#### Stay
There are only 4 suites at Klaserie Sands River Camp.  Two of these suites are standard suites, each featuring an en-suite bathroom with a shower.  There is also a family suite with an indoor &amp; outdoor shower as well as a honeymoon suite with s private deck &amp; outdoor shower.
The main area includes a comfortable dining area, bar, gym, spa &amp; swimming pool where lazy days can be spent soaking up the sun.

#### Activities
Daily activities at Klaserie Sands River Camp include safari drives in open 4x4 vehicles, exiting night drives in search of nocturnal animals &amp; adventurous walking safaris with a qualified ranger.
