At Honeyguide Mantobeni, guests will experience an authentic tented safari – without compromising on luxury, comfort &amp; style.  The lodge only allows adults, making this one of the best tented safari options for couples.

#### Stay
Mantobeni comprises 15 well-spaced tents overlooking a dry riverbed.  The tents are comfortably furnished with king-sized beds &amp; soft leather couches.  Each tent leads onto an en-suite bathroom with a bath &amp; shower.  The wooden deck area allows for unobstructed views over the dry riverbed.
The main area consists of a large sitting area, indoor &amp; outdoor areas, bar &amp; wine cellar.  There is also a sparkling swimming pool overlooking the waterhole where guests can watch wildlife drink or play from the comfort of the pool.
