### Tintswalo Manor House

#### Experience
Tintswalo Manor House is an exclusive villa located in the private Manyeleti Reserve in the Greater Kruger.
The villa can only be booked on an exclusive use basis &amp; is ideal for families or a group of friends looking for a private safari experience.
The Manyeleti Reserve is known for its low vehicle density, ensuring phenomenal private encounters with Africa’s Big 5.  Apart from the great game viewing, Tintswalo Manor House is the ideal place to reconnect with loved ones in a private bush setting.

#### Stay
This thatched villa comprises 5 luxurious suites that can accommodate a maximum of 10 people.
There are 3 en-suite, air-conditioned rooms on the ground floor (one of these bedrooms has an optional child’s room leading off it) &amp; upstairs you will find the main en-suite bedroom that boasts beautiful views of the surrounding wilderness. 
The Manor House features a large patio &amp; open-air boma where sundowners can be enjoyed.  Guests staying at Tintswalo Manor House also have full access to the spa at the main Tintswalo Safari Lodge – an ideal place to relax after a day out exploring the bush.

#### Activities
Tintswalo Manor House offers a variety of activities to its guests.  Game drives in open 4x4 safari vehicles will ensure close encounters with Africa’s Big 5 &amp; nature walks will allow guests to experience the bush on foot.
Since there is no set program for Manor House’s guests, they can enjoy more flexibility than most safari guests.  Specialized children’s programmes will keep the young ones busy &amp; are designed around the needs &amp; interests of your kids.
