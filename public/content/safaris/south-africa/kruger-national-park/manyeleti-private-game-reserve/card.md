### Manyeleti Private Game Reserve

#### Experience
The 23,000-hectare Manyeleti Private Game Reserve is a privately-owned &amp; run reserve located within the Great Kruger, offering exceptional Big 5 wildlife viewing &amp; an off-the-beaten-track wildlife experience.
This untouched part of South Africa hosts some of the country’s most the most endangered, beautiful &amp; fascinating wildlife.
Boasting only a handful of lodges, the Manyeleti Reserve offers guests an authentic &amp; wild safari experience – the way a safari should be.
The reserve is home to the coveted Big 5 – lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo &amp; rhino – as well as an abundance of other wildlife such as giraffe, zebra, impala, warthog, hippo, spotted hyena, baboon, kudu, vervet monkey, waterbuck, wildebeest, bushbaby &amp; mongoose.  
Unlike the National Park, off-road driving &amp; night drives are permitted in the Manyeleti Reserve, so here, safari enthusiasts can expect fantastic, close-up wildlife encounters.

#### Activities
Visitors get the opportunity to observe Africa’s magnificent creatures in the wild with twice-daily open 4x4 game drives &amp; nature walks with expert-led guides.  
Game drives take place twice daily - once in the morning &amp; once in the afternoon &amp; evening so that guests have an opportunity to search for nocturnal animals with a spotlight.
Off-road driving will take you straight into the action &amp; ensure wildlife encounters of the highest standard.

#### When to travel
Winter (May to September, also known as the dry season) is the best time for wildlife viewing throughout the region.  Vegetation thins during this time, so wildlife spotting is easy.
April &amp; October are considered shoulder months &amp; are also good for game viewing.  During the rainy season, December to March – the bush is lush &amp; it turns into a birder’s paradise.
