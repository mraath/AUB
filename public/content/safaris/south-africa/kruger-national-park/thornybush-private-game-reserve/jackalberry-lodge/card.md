### Jackalberry Lodge

#### Experience
Jackalberry Lodge is named after the jackalberry tree, a bushveld icon that provides shade &amp; protection from predators.  Like its namesake, the lodge offers guests a tranquil safari experience in understated elegance.
With a prime location in the Thornybush Nature Reserve, Jackalberry Lodge provides the perfect environment to reconnect with wild Africa against the backdrop of the Northern Drakensberg.
The Thornybush Nature Reserve forms part of the Greater Kruger &amp; is home to Africa’s Big 5 – lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo &amp; rhino – as well as a variety of other animals &amp; birds.

#### Stay
The lodge boasts 5 en-suite standard suites, 1 honeymoon suite &amp; 1 family suite.  
Each thatched suite boasts superb views from the private patio or corner tub, with an additional outdoor shower, allowing guests to freshen up surrounded by the sights &amp; sounds of the bush.
The honeymoon suite is more spacious than the standard suites &amp; has a private lounge.
The family suite is larger &amp; has an additional bedroom with twin beds, making this a wonderful family-friendly option.

#### Activities
Located in Big 5 territory, game drives are always exhilarating.  Guests can partake in 2 daily game drives, each lasting up to 3.5 hours.  Guided bush walks are also offered &amp; perfect for those wishing to get closer to nature.
Guests can also enjoy relaxing treatments from the Mobile Amani Spa or book a scenic hot air balloon flight over the Blyde River at an additional cost.
