# Saseka Tented Camp
## Thornybush Private Game Reserve
### Saseka Tented Camp

#### Experience
Saseka is the Tsonga word for Beautiful.  Set in the north-eastern portion of the game-rich Thornybush Nature Reserve in the Greater Kruger, Saseka is elegantly positioned on the banks of the Monwana dry-riverbed.  
The lodge is state-of-the-art, luxurious &amp; imbued with the idyllic African wilderness.  Saseka’s design means it is suitable for couples on a romantic journey as well as families with children.

#### Stay
It is a small &amp; intimate camp: there are only 8 tented suites plus a 2-bedroom villa.  
Each suite overlooks the seasonal Monwana River, which is sometimes sandy &amp; dry, sometimes flowing, but always attractive to wildlife.  Wonderful wildlife sightings are often seen from the comfort of the suites’ private viewing decks.
Each suite also boasts a private plunge pool &amp; an outdoor shower.
The 2-bedroom Leadwood Villa operates as an intimate, camp-within-a-camp, servicing 1, 2 or 3 tented suites exclusively.  The villa has a private &amp; central entertainment area that is separate from the rest of the lodge, featuring a lounge &amp; dining room.

#### Activities
Morning &amp; afternoon game drives are conducted in open 4x4 vehicles &amp; led by experienced rangers &amp; trackers who share a passion for the bush &amp; the environment.  
Guests can also enjoy relaxing treatments at the Mobile Amani Spa or book a scenic hot air balloon flight over the Blyde River at an additional cost.
Community village visits can also be arranged.
