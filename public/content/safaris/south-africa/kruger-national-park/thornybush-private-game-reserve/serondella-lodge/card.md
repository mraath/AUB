# Serondella Lodge
## Thornybush Private Game Reserve
### Serondella Lodge

#### Experience
Serondella Lodge is located within the Thornbush Game Reserve, adjacent to the Kruger National Park in South Africa &amp; is home to the Big 5 – lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo &amp; rhino.
Right in front of the lodge, an active waterhole invites plenty of wildlife to come &amp; drink during the day.  Because of the ideal location, guests often have excellent game viewing opportunities from the comfort of their viewing decks.

#### Stay
Serondella Lodge is small &amp; intimate, so is ideal for couples or a large family who is looking for a private safari experience.  There are only 4 luxurious suites, 2 of which make up the 2-bedroom family suite.
The main lodges area features a treetop lookout deck &amp; swimming pool, however, it is the deck overlooking the waterhole that is by far the most popular, &amp; keeps people coming back again &amp; again.

#### Activities
Twice daily activities are available at Serondella Lodge.  Game drives are conducted in open 4x4 safari vehicles &amp; guided nature walks are ideal for the adventurous at heart.
Guests can also enjoy relaxing treatments at the Mobile Amani Spa or book a scenic hot air balloon flight at an additional cost.  Community village visits can also be arranged.
Serondella’s bush braais (barbeques) is something to remember &amp; private dinners can also be arranged on the viewing deck with nothing but the sounds of the wild &amp; the starry skies as backdrop.
