### Kapama Private Game Reserve

#### Experience
The 13,000-hectare Kapama Private Game Reserve is located within the Greater Kruger Region just a stone’s throw from Hoedspruit Airport.  This untouched part of South Africa hosts some of the country’s most the most endangered, beautiful &amp; fascinating wildlife.
The reserve consists of open woodland &amp; tangled riverine forests &amp; is home to over 40 different species of mammals, including the coveted Big 5 – lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo &amp; rhino – as well as 350 bird species.
The reserve boasts only 4 safari lodges – each individually styled to suit a variety of needs:  from couples &amp; honeymooners to friends &amp; families.
Kapama Private Game Reserve guests will also enjoy the bonus of complimentary road transfers to &amp; from Hoedspruit Airport.

#### Activities
Visitors get the opportunity to observe Africa’s magnificent creatures in the wild with twice-daily open 4x4 game drives &amp; nature walks with expert-led guides.
Besides Big 5 game viewing, adventurous guests can enjoy hot-air balloon flights &amp; even spend a night in one of Kapama’s romantic sleep-outs under the stars.

#### When to travel
Winter (May to September, also known as the dry season) is the best time for wildlife viewing throughout the region.  
Vegetation thins during this time, while animals seeking water congregate at rivers and waterholes, &amp; this only gets better for wildlife watching as the winter goes on. 
April &amp; October are considered shoulder months &amp; are also good for game viewing.  During the rainy season, December to March – the bush is lush &amp; it turns into a birder’s paradise.
