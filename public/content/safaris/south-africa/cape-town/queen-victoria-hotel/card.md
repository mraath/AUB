## Cape Town
### Queen Victoria Hotel

#### Experience
The sophisticated Queen Victoria Hotel is situated within a precinct of heritage buildings along the main road leading to Cape Town’s V&amp;A Waterfront.
Offering the perfect base from which to explore the city, the hotel is within walking distance to the V&amp;A Waterfront’s top attractions as well as a host of fine dining restaurants, art galleries &amp; boutiques.
What makes the hotel so special, is that while it enjoys a prime location in the heart of vibrant Cape Town, it is a little removed from the main crowds, so after a day of city exploration, guests can return to a quiet slice of paradise in the middle of the hustle &amp; bustle.
Table Mountain, Clifton &amp; Camps Bay beaches are only a short drive away &amp; right next door you will find the Sanctuary Spa that offers a range of innovative treatments.

#### Stay
The Queen Victoria Hotel is home to 15 deluxe rooms, 17 premium rooms &amp; 3 suites.
The deluxe rooms are wonderfully spacious and afford guests a luxurious stay, with a range of comforts and top-class amenities.  The premium rooms are similar, but additionally, boast stunning views of Table Mountain &amp;/the harbour.
An exclusive annexe to the hotel – The Manor House – has 3 private, luxury suites &amp; come complete with private bars &amp; butler services.  These suites feature private patios or Juliet balconies, offering captivating views of Table Mountain.  Guests staying in The Manor House will also have access to a private dining room, designer spa, state-of-the-art gym &amp; a pool nestled in a beautiful, manicured garden.
Facilities at Queen Victoria include a fitness centre, swimming pool, wellness spa, restaurant &amp; cocktail bar.

#### Activities
