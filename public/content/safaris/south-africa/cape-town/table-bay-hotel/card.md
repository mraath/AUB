### Table Bay Hotel

#### Experience
The stylish Table Bay Hotel enjoys a prime location within Cape Town’s picturesque working harbour &amp; offers guests direct access to the V&amp;A Waterfront with its trendy boutiques, cafes &amp; restaurants.
The hotel has a nautical feel that is similar to some of the great cruise liners &amp; grand hotels around the world.  
With Table Mountain as the backdrop &amp; the harbour on your doorstep, it is quite wonderful to observe ships come &amp; go from the front of the hotel. 
The Table Bay Hotel offers a wonderful base from which to explore the vibrant city of Cape Town.  Only a few minutes away, the majestic Table Mountain welcomes you to South Africa’s most beautiful city &amp; a little further afield, you will find the beautiful Clifton &amp; Camps Bay beaches.

#### Stay
Each of the 329 luxury hotel rooms enjoys uninterrupted sea-facing views across the working Victoria and Alfred harbour to Table Mountain, or over the Atlantic Ocean to Robben Island. 
Hotel facilities include a heated saltwater pool, a boutique gym where guests can work up a sweat &amp; a health spa that offers a range of relaxing treatments.  
The hotel also features an on-site restaurant &amp; bar should guests wish to enjoy a relaxing evening in the comfort of the hotel.
