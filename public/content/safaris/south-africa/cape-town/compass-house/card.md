### Compass House

#### Experience
The five-star boutique hotel, Compass House enjoys a spectacular setting in trendy Bantry Bay &amp; boasts sensational views of the ocean from every room of the house.
Cape Town’s city centre is only a 10-minute drive away, so guests will have the added benefit of a 5-star beach experience that is away from the hustle &amp; bustle of city life, yet close enough to many award-winning restaurants, boutique shops &amp; top attractions.
The Atlantic Seaboard is one of the most beautiful &amp; coveted areas of Cape Town.  Not only does it offer stunning views &amp; easy beach access, but its sheltered location is a big drawcard for couples or families who want to enjoy the best of the city &amp; beach life.

#### Stay
Small &amp; intimate, this boutique-style hotel features only 5 air-conditioned suites – each boasting an en-suite bathroom &amp; private patio or balcony offering glorious views of the ocean.
The 20-meter infinity pool invites guests to relax after a day of city exploration &amp; the deck with its day salas &amp; sun loungers is a wonderful place to end the day off with sundowners.  
There is also a cosy lounge should guests wish to unwind indoors with a good book.

#### Activities
There is a never-ending list of things to do in Cape Town – from visiting Cape Town’s best beaches, shopping at the V&amp;A Waterfront &amp; wine-tasting in the Cape Winelands to spending time with the adorable penguins at Boulders Beach or having a picnic in Kirstenbosch Gardens.
Other options like shark-cage diving or whale watching can also be arranged.
