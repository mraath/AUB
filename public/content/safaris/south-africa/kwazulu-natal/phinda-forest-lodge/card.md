The spectacular Phinda Forest Lodge is set deep within the heart of a rare &amp; beautiful dry sand forest in the Kwazulu Natalâ€™s Phinda Resource Reserve.
The reserve is home to a variety of wildlife &amp; big game - including common sightings of lion, elephant, buffalo, rhino &amp; giraffe.  This award-winning lodge was built on eco-sensitive structures with a light footprint (not one tree was felled during construction).

Phinda Forest Lodge boasts 16 stilted glass chalets set amongst the forest trees, ensuring absolute privacy &amp; seclusion.  The Zulu style lodge also incorporates classic Japanese minimalist architecture, enhancing the tranquillity of this unique forest setting.
Each spacious chalet comprises a private lounge, en suite bathroom &amp; wooden viewing deck where guests can awake to the sight of nyala or duiker outside the glass walls.
The main lodge features a lounge, central dining area, open-air boma, gymnasium &amp; sparkling swimming pool overlooking the wetland pan.  Guests can sit back &amp; relax while watching wildlife in passing.
