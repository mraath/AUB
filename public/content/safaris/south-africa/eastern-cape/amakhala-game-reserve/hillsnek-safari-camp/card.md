# Hillsnek Safari Camp
## Amakhala Game Reserve
### Hillsnek Safari Camp

#### Experience
Hillsnek Safari Camp enjoys a wonderful location within a remote corner of the Amakhala Game Reserve in the Eastern Cape.  Providing an exclusive safari experience, Hillsnek ensures total privacy &amp; relaxation.
This small &amp; intimate camp is situated on the banks of the Bushman’s River – in a prime Big 5 game area.  Because of the small size of the lodge, it is easy to book it out exclusively.  With only 3 tents, a family of 6 will have the entire lodge to themselves &amp; can enjoy the services of their dedicated host, chef &amp; game ranger.

#### Stay
The 3 luxurious canvas tents are each built on a raised wooden deck &amp; are connected to the main lodge by a raised wooden walkway.  Spectacular views of the bush can be enjoyed from the comfort of your bed or even from the large ball-&amp;-claw bathtub.
Each tent is equipped with an outdoor shower, indoor &amp; outdoor sitting area as well as a private dining area for those with a romantic heart.
There is also a 2-bedroomed family unit with an inter-leading door &amp; shared bathroom.
The main lodge features a comfortable lounge, open dining area, swimming pool &amp; large viewing deck.

#### Activities
Private safari activities at Hillsnek Safari Camp include open 4x4 game drives &amp; walking safaris.
Aside from these safari activities, boat cruises along the river or canoeing are also available - proving this is one of the most unique safari locations in South Africa.
