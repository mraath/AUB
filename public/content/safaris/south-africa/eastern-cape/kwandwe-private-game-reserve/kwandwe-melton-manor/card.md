#### Experience
The world-class Kwandwe Private Game Reserve is nestled in the heart of South Africaâ€™s unspoilt Eastern Cape Province in a malaria-free private wilderness &amp; is home to Kwandwe Melton Manor.
The 22,000-hectare reserve flanks both the north &amp; south banks of the Great Fish River, attracting a variety of game, including the Big 5.
Kwandwe is the closest game reserve to the vibrant &amp; cultural Grahamstown &amp; forms part of the Garden Route, making this an ideal stopover for travellers looking for a bush &amp; beach holiday.

#### Stay
Kwandwe Melton Manor is a private space that inspires the sharing of meals, laughter &amp; experiences around the farmhouse table.
This exclusive-use villa features 4 double suites with en-suite bathrooms, generous bathtubs &amp; a large private terrace, opening onto the wilderness beyond.  
The interactive kitchen encourages guests to try their hand at combining flavours under the guidance of their in-house chef.  There is also a cosy living space, central courtyard &amp; swimming pool.

#### Activities
Open 4x4 game drives at Kwandwe never disappoint.  Apart from the Big 5, the reserve is also home to a wealth of other unique &amp; interesting animals.  
Guests can also enjoy walking safaris, fishing, rhino conservation activities, spa treatments, private campfire cooking experiences, scenic flights, bush dining &amp; picnics.
Because Kwandwe is a private reserve, night drives are permitted &amp; guests will have the opportunity to search for animals with a spotlight.
