# Samara Game Reserve
## Eastern Cape
### Samara Game Reserve

#### Experience
The award-winning Samara Private Game Reserve is nestled between an amphitheatre of mountains in South Africa’s gorgeous Eastern Cape region.
With its unique location in the Great Karoo, Samara’s 2 lodges – Samara Karoo Lodge &amp; The Manor at Samara - combine well with trips along the Garden Route.  
Guests visiting Samara will be blown away by the beautiful landscape – arguably some of the best in the country - &amp; exhilarating safari activities that include tracking cheetah on foot.
Samara is an ideal choice for discerning guests who have already ticked off the Big 5 from their safari list &amp; are looking for a secluded &amp; unique safari experience.

#### Activities
Samara Private Game Reserve offers a variety of activities to its guests.  
A few on the list are:  Open 4x4 game drives, walking trips, night safaris in search of aardvark, tracking the endangered cheetah on foot, wilderness picnics, special Kids Club Programmes &amp; romantic sleep-outs in their remote Milky Way Star Bed.

#### When to travel
The best time to travel to Samara is during the winter months of June, July &amp; August.  Daytime temperatures are mostly mild and balmy, though evenings and early mornings are cold.  What is more, generally clear skies at night mean excellent stargazing.
Spring is from September to November when the weather is similar to that of autumn (March to May), except that the days start to get longer &amp; the temperatures warmer as summer approaches. This is an ideal time for game-viewing, as many antelope have their young and the rains return.
Summer in the Karoo can be very hot, with temperatures reaching over 35ºC.  The height of summer is the period December to February.  Expect hot sunny days with the occasional afternoon thunderstorm, which makes for stunning light &amp; great photographic opportunities. 
Since the Karoo is a semi-arid area, the temperature drops off significantly once the sun goes down, so we recommend a fleece &amp;light jacket once dusk has fallen &amp; for night drives.
Summer is the best time of year to experience The Samara Milky Way Star Bed.
