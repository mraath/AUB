### Lalibela Mark's Camp

#### Experience
Lalibela Game Reserve in the Eastern Cape consists of 7,500 hectares of land &amp; is home to Africa’s Big 5 – lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo &amp; rhino.  
Only an hour away from Port Elizabeth &amp; Addo Elephant Park, Lalibela is the perfect safari getaway for guests visiting the Garden Route on a self-drive holiday.

#### Stay
Lalibela Mark’s Camp is decorated in a relaxed Pan-African style &amp; consists of 8 stone &amp; thatch chalets that can sleep 18 adults &amp; 8 children.
Each chalet is equipped with an en-suite bathroom &amp; open onto a private viewing deck with gorgeous views over the surrounding bush.  The camp overlooks a large waterhole, so it is not uncommon for guests to see a variety of wildlife right in front of the lodge!
One of the many great things about Mark’s Camp is the abundance of birdlife which can be viewed from the rooms, pool deck (there are 2 swimming pools) &amp; central lounge area.
The main area includes a bar, dining room, lounge &amp; Kids Club.

#### Activities
Guests visiting Lalibela can expect to see a variety of game during their time on safari.  Twice daily game drives in open 4x4 vehicles will ensure excellent photographic opportunities &amp; close wildlife encounters.
