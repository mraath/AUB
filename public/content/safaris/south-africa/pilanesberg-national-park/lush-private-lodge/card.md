## Pilanesberg National Park
### Lush Private Lodge

#### Experience
Tucked into a wooded hillside in a Black Rhino Reserve, a private concession in the malaria-free Pilanesberg National Park, Lush Private Lodge offers guests a unique safari experience.
Situated only a 2-hour drive from Johannesburg &amp; a stone’s throw from the renowned Sun City resort, Pilanesberg is not only home to the coveted Big 5 – lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo &amp; rhino – but hosts over 7,000 animals, more than 350 bird species as well as the rare black rhino &amp; African wild dog.
Since Lush is set in a private concession, it means one thing:  Guests can enjoy private game drives in this exclusive-use area as well as the national park, which means that they’ll have the best of both worlds.  Being in a private reserve means that you can go on guided bush walks to get even closer to nature.
Children 12 years &amp; older are welcome at Lush.

#### Stay
Lush Private Lodge has 3 bush-facing suites &amp; 2 mountain-facing suites – only distinguished by their views.  
Nestled between trees &amp; designed with absolute comfort in mind, the suites boast private decks with splash pools, cushioned loungers &amp; 2-seater tables.  En-suite bathrooms feature large freestanding bathtubs &amp; walk-in rain showers.
Communal areas include an inviting bar lounge as well as an open-plan dining &amp; lounge area with a cosy fireplace.

#### Activities
Lush offers a wide range of exciting safari activities, including open 4x4 game drives with a qualified ranger, guided walking safaris &amp; sundowners in the bush.  
Optional activities like hot air ballooning &amp; golf at Sun City can also be arranged.  Guests who prefer a little more relaxation time, can spend time at the pool, unwind with a good book or play a board game in the lodge’s comfortable bar lounge.
