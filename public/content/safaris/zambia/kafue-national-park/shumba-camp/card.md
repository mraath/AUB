# Shumba Camp
## Kafue National Park
### Shumba Camp

#### Experience
In the northern section of Zambia’s wild Kafue National Park on the legendary Busanga Plains, lies Shumba Bush Camp.
Kafue National Park is home to a wealth of game-like red lechwe, puku, zebra &amp; buffalo – a big attraction for predators like leopards, wild dogs, cheetah &amp; prides of lions.
At Shumba, the emphasis is on wildlife!  Here, guests can experience a luxury Zambia safari in a remote wilderness setting.  Not only will guests come face to face with some of Africa’s wildest predators, but excellent birding can also be enjoyed.

#### Stay
There are 6 luxury tents at Shumba, one of which is a family unity that can sleep up to 4 people.  
The tents are built on raised platforms that lead onto large balconies with breathtaking views over the surrounding plains.
Each tent has an en-suite bathroom with an indoor &amp; outdoor shower.
The main area includes a sparkling swimming pool &amp; bar where delicious cocktails can be enjoyed.

#### Activities
Shumba has a range of activities on offer.  These include day &amp; night drives, walking safaris, canoe &amp; boating trips as well as fishing excursions.  
Specialized birding safaris can also be arranged to spot as many of the 400 recorded species as possible.
