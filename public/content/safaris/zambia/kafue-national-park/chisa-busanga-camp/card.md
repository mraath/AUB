# Chisa Busanga Camp
## Kafue National Park
### Chisa Busanga Camp

#### Experience
Situated in the middle of Busanga Plains, the crown of Kafue National Park, Chisa Busanga is one of Africa’s most unique camps.
The word ‘chisa’ means ‘bird’s nest’ in the local Nyanja language &amp; the rooms were inspired by the weaver bird nests that decorate the trees here.
These unusual &amp; luxurious ‘nests’ were designed by an international architect who wanted to mimic the Busanga Plains’ beautiful surrounds through innovative &amp; environmentally conscious design.
Solar power is used throughout the camp – from the main areas &amp; nests to the game drive vehicles &amp; bicycles used to explore the shallow wetlands beyond.
The area is famous for its frequent lion sightings &amp; endless game viewing opportunities.

#### Stay
Small &amp; intimate, the camp boasts 4 spacious nests that blend seamlessly into the wild outdoors, while paying attention to modern comforts needed for a comfortable sleeping experience.  
What is better than waking up to elephants walking through the mist that rises off the drying floodplains below or falling asleep a little closer to the stars?
Each of the nests has a private deck – the perfect spot to gaze out over the Busanga Plains &amp; a natural waterhole where plenty of animal activity takes place.  Romantic travellers will be happy to hear that private lunches &amp; dinners can be arranged on the comfort of their viewing deck.
The communal area also includes a swimming pool where relaxing post-safari afternoons can be spent.

#### Activities
Chisa Busanga offers a range of exciting activities, including open 4x4 game drives, mountain bike safaris &amp; hot air balloon flights over the scenic Busanga Plains.  
Guests can also cool off in the swimming pool &amp; share interesting stories around the campfire under a canopy of stars.
