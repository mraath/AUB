# Kafue National Park
## Zambia
### Kafue National Park

#### Experience
Kafue National Park is Zambia’s largest conservation area &amp is only accessible via daily charter flights, making this one of Zambia’s most off-the-beaten-track safari destinations.
Utterly remote &amp very wild, Kafue guests can enjoy excellent big game viewing with barely another vehicle in sight!
There are only a handful of luxury tented camps found here – most of which overlook the game-packed Busanga Plains in the northeast corner of the reserve. The vast, grassy floodplains are the grazing grounds for huge numbers of buffalo, wildebeest, red lechwe &amp puku antelope, all of which are preyed on by predators like cheetah, wild dog, spotted hyena &amp lion.
Apart from Kafue’s phenomenal wildlife encounters, guests can also expect spectacular pink sunrises, breathtaking scenery &amp a host of exciting Zambia safari activities.
A Kafue safari can easily be combined with Zambia’s other wildlife regions: South Luangwa, Lower Zambezi &amp the majestic Victoria Falls in Livingstone.

#### Activities
Kafue guests can enjoy a wide range of Zambia safari activities, including open 4x4 game drives, nocturnal-focused night drives, hot air balloon safaris, guided walks, boating, canoeing &amp bird watching.
The water-based safaris in boats or canoes will focus on aquatic wildlife such as hippos &amp crocodiles while land-based game drives will take guests straight into the world of predators. Guests can appreciate some of the smaller animals on guided walking safaris while bird lovers can add a staggering 490 species to their bird list.

#### When to travel
The best time to visit Kafue is from June to October during the dry season. The bush has dried out &amp thirsty animals head to rivers &amp waterholes, which makes these the best months for wildlife viewing.
Most camps in the Busanga Plains close during the wet season from December to March. April to June is considered shoulder season. During this time, the water levels are high, which means that water-based safaris can be enjoyed in full swing. Game viewing is good &amp birding is excellent.
