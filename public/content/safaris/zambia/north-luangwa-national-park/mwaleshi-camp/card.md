# Mwaleshi Camp
## North Luangwa National Park
### Mwaleshi Camp

#### Experience
North Luangwa National Park is Africa’s best-kept secret.  In this off-the-beaten-track Zambian reserve, there are only a handful of lodges, including Mwaleshi Camp.
There are not many roads found in this area &amp; game viewing is exclusively conducted on walking safaris with experienced &amp; professional guides &amp; trackers – in fact, some of the best in the country!
Guests can be on the lookout for hyena, puku, wildebeest, eland &amp; the frequently spotted lion &amp; buffalo.

#### Stay
Small &amp; intimate, Mwaleshi has only 4 chalets sleeping 8 guests in total.  
Each chalet comes with an en-suite bathroom with flush toilets &amp; running water from overhead drums that are filled daily.  
Hot water is provided in the evening unless otherwise specified.  There is a centrally located inverter re-charging facility available for guests’ use.
The traditional central hut covers a comfortable seating area with a small library as well as a bar &amp; dining table.
There is no electricity at camp, but lighting is provided by solar-powered lamps.  The absence of electricity promotes more time around a crackling campfire, therefore offering adventurous travellers a true wilderness experience.

#### Activities
The focus at Mwaleshi Camp is exploring the bush on foot with armed &amp; professional guides.  
Guests can also cool off in the clear, safe waters of the river or take a day trip to the nearby Mwaleshi Falls.
