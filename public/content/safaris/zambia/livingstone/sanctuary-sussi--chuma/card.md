### Sanctuary Sussi & Chuma

#### Experience
Sanctuary Sussi &amp; Chuma is a tree-fort safari lodge set on a dramatic bend of the Zambezi River within the game-packed Mosi-Oa-Tunya Park, upstream from the legendary Victoria Falls.
Named after Dr David Livingstone’s knowledgeable &amp; local guides, Sussi &amp; Chuma is a laid-back, family-friendly lodge where guests can enjoy the park’s peace &amp; tranquillity, while still being close enough to the action-packed Victoria Falls with all its fun-filled activities.

#### Stay
Surrounded by large ebony &amp; jackalberry trees, Sussi &amp; Chuma comprises 12 elegant tree-house suites connected by wooden walkways.  From here awe-inspiring views over the hippo-filled river can be observed.
Each treehouse includes air-conditioning, en-suite facilities with a bathtub as well as a private viewing deck.
The central area at Sussi &amp; Chuma features a lounge, dining room, spa, bar &amp; swimming pool where lazy afternoons can be enjoyed.

#### Activities
Sanctuary Sussi &amp; Chuma includes a range of activities, such as game drives in the Mosi-Oa-Tunya National Park (which is home to white rhino), canoe safaris on the Zambezi River, relaxing nature walks, boating safaris or village visits.
Spa treatments can also be booked.
In addition to the above, guests can also do a trip to Livingstone town &amp; enjoy a microlight flight over the Falls, river rafting, day trips to Livingstone Island, swimming at Devil’s Pool &amp; much more.
