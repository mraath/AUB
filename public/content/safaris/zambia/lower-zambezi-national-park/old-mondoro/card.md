### Old Mondoro

#### Experience
The seasonal Old Mondoro (open from April to November) boasts a beautiful location on the banks of the great Zambezi River, overlooking a maze of hippo-filled channels &amp; small islands in the Lower Zambezi National Park.
This ‘back-to-basics’ camp focuses on providing guests with an authentic safari experience with enough comfort, without being side-tracked from the viewing wildlife.
Owner-managed &amp; run, Old Mondoro will provide guests with exceptional, personalized service &amp; a high standard of guiding.  The owners are passionate conservationists who are deeply involved with preserving Zambia’s wildlife.

#### Stay
Old Mondoro is small &amp; intimate, with only 5 chalets as well as a 6th 2-bedroom family chalet.  
Each reed chalet has a canvas roof that is left open during the day, maximizing natural light &amp; the Lower Zambezi’s beautiful natural surroundings.  The large outdoor stone tub &amp; shower are open to the stars &amp; river.  
All chalets have huge private decks with expansive views as well as a chill zone with day beds where guests can relax while watching the elephants pass by only meters from the chalets.
The 2-bedroom chalet is ideal for families travelling with children.
The main tent overlooks the Zambezi River &amp; serves as Old Mondoro’s lounge &amp; dining area.

#### Activities
A variety of land &amp; water-based activities is available.  These include boating or canoeing on the river, game drives, walking safaris, bird watching &amp; fishing.
