Each tented suite boasts a lounge &amp; dining area, an expansive deck with a private pool as well as an indoor bathroom with an outdoor shower.  Personal butlers are allocated to all tents to attend to guests’ every whim.  
Kigelia House, the 2-bedroom villa consists of an open plan living area leading onto a private deck with a swimming pool.
The main lodge area features a lounge, dining room, library, bar &amp; swimming pool.
