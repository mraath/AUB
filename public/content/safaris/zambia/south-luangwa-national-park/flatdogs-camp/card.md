### Flatdogs Camp

#### Experience
Flatdogs Camp is unique in every way!  Situated on the border of the South Luangwa National Park, one of the last great wildlife wonders of the world, the camp has been visited by wildlife enthusiasts since its creation in 1972.
What makes the camp so unique, is that it caters for absolutely everyone!  Not only is the wildlife viewing in this part of Zambia spectacular, but they also offer a wide range of accommodation options to suit all budgets &amp; tastes.

#### Stay
At Flatdogs, you will find 6 safari tents (including 1 family tent), 6 chalets &amp; 2 private houses. 
The safari tents boast a beautiful location on the banks of the Luangwa River &amp; offer the best views in camp.  Each tent is spacious &amp; features an open-air bathroom.  The family tent can accommodate 4 people.
The chalets are made of stone &amp; are found in 3 separate buildings.  Each chalet building has a downstairs bedroom &amp; upstairs bedroom, both with en-suite bathrooms &amp; private sitting areas.  The 2 rooms in each building are completely separate but can be joined through the small kitchen area if a family or group of friends want to book both rooms.
The 2 private houses offer exclusive safari accommodation with private guides &amp; vehicles.  
The first house, Crocodile Nest is a large tented ‘house’ with 2 en-suite bathrooms &amp; lovely views overlooking the Luangwa River.  The house also boasts indoor-outdoor living spaces &amp; a private pool.
The second house, Jackalberry Treehouse has 3 main decks built 8 feet off the ground with wooden stairways to reach the spacious sitting area &amp; 2 open-air, en-suite bedrooms.  The middle deck offers a comfortable sofa, easy chairs &amp; floor cushions – the ideal spot to watch game wandering past the treehouse.
