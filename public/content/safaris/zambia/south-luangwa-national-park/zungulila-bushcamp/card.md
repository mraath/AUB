### Zungulila Bushcamp

#### Experience
Zungulila Bushcamp boasts a beautiful setting overlooking the Kapamba River in Zambia’s South Luangwa National Park.
The camp sits on a raised knoll above picturesque plains &amp; natural springs – a magnet for attracting wildlife year-round.
South Luangwa is as wild &amp; remote as it gets, but Zungulila does not compromise on the everyday comforts!  Travellers looking for an authentic tented safari experience combined with a little luxury will fall in love with Zungulila.
The camp is seasonal &amp; only open from April to January – during the best wildlife season.

#### Stay
Zungulila has 4 spacious tented suites built under thatched roofs.  
Each tent boasts a private bamboo veranda with panoramic views over an impressive variety of wildlife – from thirsty elephants at the springs &amp; flocks of birds by the river to prowling lions &amp; large herds of buffalo on the grassy plains.
The en-suite bathrooms have outdoor showers &amp; sunken plunge pools for hot summer days.  
The main area comprises a lounge area, a large wooden deck where al fresco dinners are served under the stars &amp; an open-air boma.

#### Activities
Activities at Zungulila Bushcamp include day &amp; night drives in open 4x4 vehicles in search of Africa’s fiercest predators as well as guided walking safaris where a qualified tracker will share his expert knowledge of the bush. 
Guests can also relax on the deck while watching animals drink or play in the nearby waterhole.
