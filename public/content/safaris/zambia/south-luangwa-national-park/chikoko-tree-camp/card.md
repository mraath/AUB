# Chikoko Tree Camp
## South Luangwa National Park
### Chikoko Tree Camp

#### Experience
The secluded &amp; seasonally operated Chikoko Tree Camp is situated on the banks of the Luangwa River, deep in the heart of South Luangwa’s northern region.
There are no roads leading to Chikoko, allowing guests a true off-the-beaten-track wilderness experience.  The camp is ideal for adventure-lovers looking for a little bit of “rustic” Africa.
Home to a vast number of animals &amp; over 400 bird species, South Luangwa will not disappoint.

#### Stay
The camp features 3 double-storey reed chalets, resting 3 metres above a grove of ebony trees.  
Each has an open-air bathroom consisting of a flush toilet &amp; shower.  Solar power provides electric lighting for the rooms.
The chalets look out over the bush where an array of wildlife activity unfolds throughout the day.
The communal area includes a comfortable lounge &amp; bar.

#### Activities
Chikoko Tree Camp’s activities are primarily based on walking safaris with an experienced ranger &amp; tracker.  Morning walks are 4 hours long &amp; afternoon walks are generally shorter.
Bird watching is also popular in South Luangwa.
