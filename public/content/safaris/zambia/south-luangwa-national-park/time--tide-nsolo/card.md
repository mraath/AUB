# Time + Tide Nsolo
## South Luangwa National Park
### Time + Tide Nsolo

#### Experience
Nsolo – named after the honeyguide bird – is built on a raised wooden platform along a bend in the seasonal Luwi River in the heart of Zambia’s South Luangwa National Park.
There are no other camps for miles around &amp; it is here where you will find one of the densest concentrations of game in Africa - including elephant, hippo, lion, leopard, wild dog, giraffe, wildebeest &amp; 400 striking &amp; unusual bird species.
Time + Tide Nsolo makes a great base for their signature activity: “Sleep out under the Stars” &amp; around the corner you will find a wild dog den that is frequently visited by Nsolo guests.
Lion prides often use the dry riverbed as a thoroughfare, so safaris around camp offer big game viewing at its best.

#### Stay
Nsolo has 5 charming chalets stretched out on raised wooden platforms – each with gorgeous views over the seasonal Luwi River.  
The chalets have open-air en-suite bathrooms &amp; private decks offering views over the game-packed, permanent river lagoon.
The main area features a communal &amp; spacious lounge, dining room &amp; bar.

#### Activities
Activities at Nsolo include day &amp; night drives in open 4x4 vehicles in search of Africa’s fiercest predators as well as guided walking safaris where a qualified tracker will share his expert knowledge of the bush. 
Guests can also visit the nearby wild dog den or sleep out under the stars if they are feeling adventurous.
