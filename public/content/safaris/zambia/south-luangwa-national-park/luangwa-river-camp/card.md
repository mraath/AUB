## South Luangwa National Park
### Luangwa River Camp

#### Experience
Luangwa River Camp sits nestled under an ancient ebony grove on the banks of the Luangwa River in one of the last unspoilt wilderness areas in Africa:  The South Luangwa National Park.
This game-rich area - called the Luangwa Wafwa - is filled with its oxbow lagoons, riverine woodlands &amp; large plains - &amp; is home to an abundance of game, including lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo, giraffe, hippo &amp; over 450 bird species.
Guests travelling to South Luangwa will be able to explore this pristine bush environment on foot while being accompanied by an expert guide.

#### Stay
Luangwa River Camp is small &amp; intimate, with only 5 brick &amp; thatch bush suites, each with an en-suite bathroom with a sunken bathtub looking out onto your private corner of Africa.  
The bedroom &amp; bathroom at each suite is a-fronted, with large sliding doors leading onto a wooden deck allowing great views onto the river.
At the main lodge area, you will find a dining room, bar &amp; swimming pool where further relaxation can take place.

#### Activities
Walking safaris are the focus at Luangwa River Camp, although open 4x4 game drives are also offered for guests interested to go further afield or look for nocturnal animals with a spotlight.
Seasonable boating safaris will give guests front row seats to exploring the hippo-filled river with all its animal activity.
