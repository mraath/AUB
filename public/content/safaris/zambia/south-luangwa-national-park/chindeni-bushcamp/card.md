# Chindeni Bushcamp
## South Luangwa National Park
### Chindeni Bushcamp

#### Experience
Chindeni Bushcamp is situated deep within the wildlife-rich South Luangwa National Park Zambia &amp; offers guests an authentic safari experience.
This intimate &amp; remote safari camp boasts an ideal setting on the meandering Luangwa River, with views over a wildlife-packed lagoon where hippo, puku &amp; other wildlife, like large herds of elephants, can be frequently spotted.
Travellers looking for an off-the-beaten-track luxury safari experience will love Chindeni with its beautiful thatch chalets – the perfect blend between traditional safari &amp; modern living.

#### Stay
Chindeni love to keep things personal, so there are only 4 en-suite canvas tents, each with a private deck from which guests can spot big game making their way to the lagoon.
The tents are the most spacious in the Luangwa!
The main area at Chindeni incorporates a dining area &amp; bar that is built on stilts above the oxbow lagoon with an adjoining lounge area for relaxing.  During the hot month of October, guests have been known to see more game from the deck than on a drive!

#### Activities
The main activities available at Chindeni are early morning &amp; afternoon guided bush walks where guests can explore the bush on foot &amp; learn about the local fauna &amp; flora.  
Evening game drives are also offered for close-up wildlife encounters with lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo &amp; wild dog.
Safari goers can also enjoy the flexibility of walking to one of Chindeni’s sister camps, an exciting activity that takes half a day &amp; allows guests to track big game on foot.
