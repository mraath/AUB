## Liwonde National Park
### Mvuu Lodge

#### Experience
Mvuu Lodge is set on the banks of a tranquil lagoon just off the beautiful Shire River in Liwonde National Park – Malawi’s premier safari destination.
Mvuu means “hippo” in Tonga &amp; aptly so – there are large numbers of these water-loving mammals that float in the river.  
In this lush &amp; fertile area, an excellent diversity of animals can be seen.  Liwonde is also a great destination for bird watchers, especially around the Shire River.

#### Stay
Accommodation at Mvuu Lodge comprises 8 luxury tents overlooking a palm-fringed lagoon, one of which is a romantic honeymoon suite. 
Each tent features an en-suite bathroom with a bathtub as well as an indoor &amp; outdoor shower that leads out to a private deck built to look over the water.
Lodge facilities include a dining room, bar, lounge &amp; swimming pool.

#### Activities
Mvuu Lodge has a variety of safari activities on the menu.  
These include boat safaris, guided nature walks, morning &amp; afternoon game drives as well as bicycle trips to local villages to meet some of the friendly people Malawi is so famous for.
