# Liwonde National Park
## Malawi
### Liwonde National Park

#### Experience
Liwonde National Park is one of Malawi’s hidden gems. Smaller than some of the other African parks, Liwonde is nevertheless the closest thing the country has to a classic big game reserve.
At its center, you will find the Shire River – a magnet for larger animals. Liwonde National Park safari &amp boating safaris along the palm-fringed shores of the Shire River are usually the best way to get closer to some of the larger animals like elephant &amp hippo. The park's unique experiences include Liwonde bird watching &amp Liwonde guided walking safaris.
Recently, black rhino has been reintroduced to the area, which means that Liwonde has become a Liwonde Big 5 reserve, but bear in mind that sightings of the big cats – leopard &amp lion – are rare. Safari goers who simply wish to tick off a Liwonde Big 5 checklist should rather opt for another destination.
A Liwonde safari will appeal to adventure travelers who prefer an off-the-beaten-track environment where the focus is not only on larger animals but on smaller creatures too. Adventure travel in Liwonde offers opportunities like Liwonde rhino tracking &amp Liwonde nocturnal animal sightings.
Bird watching in Liwonde is spectacular! With a crossover between Southern &amp East African species, Liwonde offers among the best bird watching in Central Africa.

#### Activities
Liwonde National Park offers a wide selection of safari activities, including Liwonde rhino tracking, Liwonde guided walking safaris, and Liwonde bird watching. Boating safaris along the palm-fringed shores of the Shire River is a wonderful way of getting close to wildlife, &amp open 4x4 game drives explore the park’s expansive floodplains in search for sable &amp roan antelope, buffalo &amp impala.
Night drives in Liwonde offer the chance of seeing elusive nocturnal animals such as jackal, hyena &amp serval cats. For those interested in Liwonde black rhino safari, there's a separate rhino sanctuary within the reserve.

#### When to travel
Liwonde National Park offers great wildlife viewing throughout the year, but the best months are the dry winter months, from May to October when the grass is low, which makes it easier to spot wildlife. At this time, water in the bush has dried out &amp animals congregate at the river.
Keep in mind that October is very hot and not the ideal time for being in the bush.
During the rainy season – between December &amp March, the conditions are generally hot and wet.
