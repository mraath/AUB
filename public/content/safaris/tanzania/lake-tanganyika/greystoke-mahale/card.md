## Lake Tanganyika
### Greystoke Mahale

#### Experience
Set on a remote beach on the shores of Lake Tanganyika in the chimp-inhabited forests of the Mahale Mountains in West Tanzania, lies Greystoke Mahale – an intimate &amp; exclusive jungle retreat.
The Mahale Mountains National Park hosts the largest known population of chimpanzees in the world as well as a variety of other wildlife, like leopard, bushbuck, bush pig &amp; many bird species.
With a beautiful setting on Lake Tanganyika, the world’s second-largest freshwater lake in the world (&amp; home to 250 species of tropical fish), Greystoke offers guests the perfect blend between land &amp; water-based safari activities.

#### Stay
Small &amp; intimate, Greystoke Mahale has only 6 open-fronted thatched cottages that have been tucked into the treeline, almost invisible to the passing fishermen in their small canoes.
Each cottage has an en-suite bathroom &amp; private veranda as well as an upstairs chill-out lounge with views across the white sand to the vastness of Lake Tanganyika.
The eco-friendly communal space features a dining area, bar &amp; library where lazy afternoons can be spent.

#### Activities
A variety of fun-filled land &amp; water-based safari activities is available at Greystoke.
These include chimpanzee trekking safaris, guided forest walks, bird watching, swimming in the ice-cold pools up in the mountain waterfalls, kayaking, snorkelling &amp; fishing.
