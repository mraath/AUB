# Mahale Lodge
## Lake Tanganyika
### Mahale Lodge

#### Experience
Tucked away in one of the most remote corners of Tanzania along the shores of Lake Tanganyika, lies Mahale Lodge – a luxurious yet off-the-beaten-track island retreat.
The thick rainforest of the Mahale Mountains is home to the densest known population of wild, endangered chimpanzees &amp; therefore offers a unique opportunity to trek them on foot.  
Birding is also exceptional, as there are over 350 recorded species in the region.
The lodge is so secluded, it can only be accessed by flight &amp; then by boat.  One of the most remote travel destinations in Tanzania, this lodge would suit seasoned travellers who are looking for a unique wildlife experience.
Children of all ages are welcome at Mahel Lodge, although the minimum age for chimpanzee trekking is 12 years old, so we recommend travelling with older kids.

#### Stay
Scattered along the beach &amp; overlooking the lake, you will find 10 luxury beach chalets, including 1 family chalet.
Each chalet is raised on a wooden deck &amp; covered by a high thatched roof.  Each has an en-suite bathroom &amp; a small veranda to the front with a day bed &amp; directors chairs – a perfect spot to watch the sunset over the lake in front.  
The thatched lounge &amp; dining area is the focal point of the camp &amp; houses a bar &amp; mezzanine deck offering beautiful views over the beach &amp; lake.  There is also a fire pit on the beach for evening drinks &amp; occasional dining.

#### Activities
A variety of fun-filled land &amp; water-based safari activities is available at Mahale Lodge.
These include chimpanzee trekking, boating, canoeing, snorkelling, kayaking, bird watching &amp; fishing.
