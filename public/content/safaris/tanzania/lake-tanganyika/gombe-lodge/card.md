Lake Tanganyika is the second largest freshwater lake world &amp; attracts a variety of wildlife, like olive baboons, energetic vervet, red-tailed &amp; red colobus monkeys, bush pigs, hippos &amp; leopards as well over 200 bird species.

With African-inspired décor, each tent features an en-suite bathroom &amp; a private deck overlooking the lush forest.
The combined lounge &amp; dining area at the main lodge is built above the forest floor offering spectacular views over the lake &amp; mountains. There is also a lodge library for keen readers.
