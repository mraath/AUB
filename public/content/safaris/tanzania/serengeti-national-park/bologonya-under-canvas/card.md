# Bologonya Under Canvas
## Serengeti National Park
### Bologonya Under Canvas

#### Experience
Adventure seekers will love Bologonya Under Canvas, an authentic mobile tented camp affording guests the chance to experience the less frequented &amp; more remote areas of the Serengeti National Park.
The camp changes location 3 times a year, which means that guests will have front row seats to one of Africa’s largest wildlife spectacles:  The Great Wildebeest Migration.  
Due to the changing nature of the camp, guests will be able to observe the complete migration circuit – including the birth of calves to the moment the wildebeests reach their end destination.
The camp is seasonal &amp; operates only during high season, from June to November.

#### Stay
There are 10 Meru-style tents &amp; 1 family tent at Bologonya Under Canvas.  Authentic in style, but comfortable in execution, the tents meet all modern-day needs.
Each tent features an en-suite bathroom with a bucket shower &amp; flush toilet as well as a private veranda with a view of the sprawling Serengeti plains.
An authentic Meru-style canvas tent houses the main lounge with comfortable sofas as well as the indoor dining area.  Guests are invited to the sizzling campfire to enjoy pre-dinner drinks or share interesting safari stories.

#### Activities
Bologonya Under Canvas has a variety of activities on the safari menu.
These include open 4x4 game drives, hot air balloon safaris in season &amp; bush dining.
