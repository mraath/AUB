### Lamai Serengeti Camp

#### Experience
Perched on the scenic Kogakuria Kopjes (hilltop), in the far north of the Serengeti National Park, lies the luxurious &amp; eco-friendly Lamai Serengeti Camp.
Its ideal location promises jaw-dropping views towards the Mara River Valley &amp; the Lamai Wedge – the perfect place from which to witness the iconic Great Migration.
Close enough to the Mara River, guests can experience the world-renowned river crossings where masses of animals brace the deep, fast-flowing water &amp; the massive crocodiles that live within it.
Lamai Serengeti Camp not only offers front row seats to one of the greatest wildlife spectacles on Earth but promises superb year-round wildlife viewing, including frequent sightings of the famous Big 5 – lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo &amp; rhino.

#### Stay
The camp comprises 12 stone &amp; thatch en-suite chalets, raised on wooden decks.  Three of these have an adjoining room for kids, sharing a bathroom.
Each open-fronted chalet has roll-down canvas doors that can be opened or closed as needed, as well as a private veranda with a comfortable day bed where relaxing afternoons can be spent.
The main lodge area is set on several levels to enhance the spectacular views from the Kogakurio Kopjes from every possible angle.  
The first lounge has plenty of comfy sofas &amp; a fireplace for cooler winter evenings while slightly below, you will find a circular seating area &amp; safari bar – both offering beautiful views.  A secluded pool is tucked away among the boulders – an ideal relaxation zone that offers further views of the Serengeti.

#### Activities
Lamai Serengeti Tented Camp offers open 4x4 game drives in open safari vehicles as well as guided walking safaris where guests will learn more about the local fauna &amp; flora.
Special bush picnics are always a highlight &amp; romantic sundowner excursions are the perfect way to end a day in the bush.
