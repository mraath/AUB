### Grumeti Serengeti River Lodge

#### Experience
Grumeti Serengeti River Lodge lies deep in the heart of Tanzania’s Serengeti National Park in an emerald forest overlooking an oxbow lagoon of the Grumet River.
This fantastic location near the water invites playful hippos, thumbless pied colobus monkeys &amp; other animals to quench their thirst – so guests can enjoy armchair game viewing from the comfort of the viewing deck.
During the annual Wildebeest Migration, the camp is perfectly positioned to witness millions of wildebeest, zebra &amp; gazelle chase across the Grumeti River, home to Africa’s largest &amp; most powerful Nile crocodile.
Superb year-round wildlife viewing can be found here, since Serengeti National Park hosts 35 species of plains game, including the Big 5, cheetahs, spotted hyenas, as well as a variety of birds.
At night, resident hippos can be heard wallowing in the lagoon – the perfect way to fall asleep in Africa.

#### Stay
Grumeti Serengeti River Lodge offers 10 rustic, yet sophisticated tented suites that blend perfectly into their environment.
Each tented suite features an en-suite bathroom with an open-air shower &amp; a shaded private veranda with a big day bed overlooking the river frontage.
The family tent can sleep 5 guests &amp; comprises 2 bedrooms, connected by a wooden walkway.
Intimate guest areas include open-fronted sitting &amp; dining areas, a domed safari bar &amp; a rim-flow swimming pool overlooking the seasonal hippo pools below.  The large sun deck offers spectacular views over the river.  There is also a crackling campfire for cosy winter evenings.

#### Activities
Activities at Grumeti Serengeti River Lodge include open 4x4 game drives, hot air balloon safaris, day trips to Lake Victoria &amp; relaxing spa treatments.
