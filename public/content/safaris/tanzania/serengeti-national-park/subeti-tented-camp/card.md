# Subeti Tented Camp
## Serengeti National Park
### Subeti Tented Camp

#### Experience
Set on a hill in the private Maswa Kimali Game Reserve, bordering the Serengeti National Park &amp; the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, lies Subeti Tented Camp.
Having this advantageous position allows guests to enjoy sensational views &amp; some of the best game viewing in Tanzania – especially during the Great Wildebeest Migration which takes place annually. (In this region, between January &amp; April.) 
Because the camp is so small, travellers have the option to book Subeti on an exclusive-use basis, which means that the entire safari experience is private.  A dedicated guide, safari vehicle &amp; chef will look after your every need &amp; activities are customized.
A welcoming treat to Subeti is that the camp not only offers morning &amp; afternoon game drives like most others, but because of its private concession location, also offers guided bush walks &amp; thrilling night safaris.

#### Stay
Small &amp; intimate – almost boutique-like – Subeti offers only 3 tented suites that can be shared by others or booked exclusively by one family or group of friends.
Each tent is sophisticated &amp; minimalistic in style, featuring an en-suite bathroom with bathtub, shower &amp; viewing deck with lounge chairs – the perfect place to laze away the afternoon.
The unfussy main lodge is home to a lounge, bar &amp; dining area.

#### Activities
A range of exciting safari activities is available at Subeti Tented Camp.  
These include open 4x4 game drives with a qualified ranger, night drives in search of nocturnal animals, guided walking safaris, romantic sundowner excursions &amp; bush dinners.
