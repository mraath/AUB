As the only permanent tented camp in Tanzania’s southern Serengeti, the eco-friendly Sanctuary Kusini is all about seclusion &amp; wildlife.
With an awe-inspiring vantage point from a rocky outcrop, the camp overlooks the surrounding woodlands &amp; game-rich plains where millions of antelope congregate during one of nature’s most amazing spectacles:  The Great Wildebeest Migration.
Not only does the southern Serengeti offer superb migration game viewing in season, but is also home to the famous Big 5, hungry predators &amp; a variety of plains game.

Accommodation is offered in 12 luxury tented suites, scattered around the main kopje. (hill)

The main lodge area includes a comfortable lounge, dining room, well-stocked library, safari bar, wellness spa &amp; large deck overlooking the bush.
