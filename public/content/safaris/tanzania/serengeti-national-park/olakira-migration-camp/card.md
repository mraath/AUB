### Olakira Migration Camp

#### Experience
Olakira Migration Camp moves around the sun-kissed Serengeti plains twice a year in pursuit of nature’s greatest wildlife spectacle:  The Great Wildebeest Migration.
Guests will have row seats to dramatic river crossings in the north (June – November) or wildebeests giving birth in the south (December – March) - a bucket list experience for every safari enthusiast!
Apart from the iconic Wildebeest Migration, Olakira also offers superb year-round wildlife viewing &amp; a range of exciting safari activities.

#### Stay
Olakira’s 9 mesh-covered stargazing tents offer a modern take on East Africa’s vintage charm.  One of these tents is a family unit.
Each luxury tent features an en-suite bathroom with a hot-water safari bucket shower &amp; flushing toilet as well as an undercover veranda offering glorious views of the Serengeti.
The communal open-sided mess tent includes a cosy lounge, dining space &amp; safari bar where pre-dinner drinks can be enjoyed.

#### Activities
Olakira Migration Camp’s various locations offer a range of exciting safari activities.
These include open 4x4 safari drives, thrilling hot air balloon safaris over the plains of the Serengeti, bird watching, bush dinners, stargazing – even from your bed – or romantic sundowner excursions.
