# Ubuntu Migration Camp
## Serengeti National Park
### Ubuntu Migration Camp

#### Experience
This back-to-basics mobile safari camp moves location 3 times a year in pursuit of the greatest wildlife spectacle on Earth:  The Great Wildebeest Migration.
Ubuntu Migration Camp offers a simple set-up with a raw wilderness feel, which delicately balances safari authenticity with guest comfort.
Between May &amp; July, the camp is pitched in the western corridor between the Nyakoroma Hills &amp; the border of the Serengeti to catch the wildebeest as they cross the crocodile-infested Grumeti River.  
From July to October, the camp moves to the northern Serengeti – in time to witness the iconic Mara River crossings.
Between December &amp; March, Ubuntu is set up in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area where millions of wildebeest, zebra &amp; gazelle are happily grazing.

#### Stay
Offering an intimate feel, Ubuntu Migration Camp consists of only 8 classic safari tents.
Each tent has an en-suite bathroom with a fire-heated bucket shower &amp; flush toilet as well as a private veranda offering glorious views over the wilderness.
The communal area consists of 2 separate canvas tents – both overlooking the game-rich plains.  The ‘living room’ tent boasts comfortable sofas, bean bags &amp; board games, whereas the ‘dining room’ tent hosts a small bar &amp; a tea-&amp;-coffee station.

#### Activities
A range of exciting safari activities is available at Ubuntu Migration Camp.
These include open 4x4 game drives, hot air balloon safaris, local village visits, bush picnics &amp; stargazing.
