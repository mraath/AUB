#### Experience
Witnessing the annual Wildebeest Migration is on everyone’s bucket list - &amp; rightly so!  Sanctuary Kichakani moves between 3 different locations in the iconic Serengeti, in pursuit of Earth’s greatest wildlife spectacle.
Kichakani guests will be included in some of the most dramatic events in Migration season – be it seeing millions of antelope on the move, witnessing wildebeest &amp; their young during calving season or the cherry on top:  the river crossings.
The wildebeest have to move back to the Masai Mara in Kenya &amp; therefore is forced to cross various crocodile-infested rivers – an East African highlight!
Apart from witnessing this amazing annual wildlife event, the central Serengeti is also famous for its reliable predator sightings, so guests can be on the lookout for lions, leopards, cheetah &amp; wild dog.
Honeymooners or couples who want to immerse themselves in the Migration experience, without compromising on modern comforts, will fall in love with Sanctuary Kichakani.

#### Stay
Sanctuary Kichakani boasts 10 contemporary, stylish en-suite tents complete with authentic safari bucket showers &amp; private viewing decks.

Guests can order a drink from the safari bar or share interesting safari stories around the crackling campfire.
