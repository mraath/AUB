### Serengeti Sojourn Camp

#### Experience
Serengeti Sojourn is an elite mobile camp that moves twice a year within Tanzania’s flagship Serengeti National Park in pursuit of the annual Wildebeest Migration.
Between June &amp; October, the camp is pitched in the exclusive Lobo area, within close proximity to both the Grumeti &amp; Mara Rivers – the stages for the migration’s action-aced river crossings.
From mid-December to March, the camp moves to a hilltop in the Ndutu region, offering sweeping views of Lake Ndutu where large herds graze, rut &amp; calve.
Throughout the year, guests can expect superb wildlife viewing, including exceptional sightings of big cats as well as elephant, buffalo &amp; giraffe.
Serengeti Sojourn is a wonderful choice for families with children between the ages of 6 &amp; 15.  The Rafiki Explorer Club will keep kids entertained, &amp; through fun-filled activities, teach them about the African bush &amp; its animals.
