# Mbono Tented Camp
## Serengeti National Park
### Mbono Tented Camp

#### Experience
Set in a private concession on the banks of the beautiful Mbono River close to the Serengeti National Park, lies Mbono Tented Camp.
Its ideal location allows guests to experience the best of both worlds – access to one of East Africa’s most famous wilderness areas &amp; exclusive access to the concession – away from crowds!
Each party is assigned a dedicated safari vehicle &amp; guide, which means that guests can be ‘selfish’ on safari &amp; explore the bush at their own pace.
Not only is the Serengeti known for its superb Big 5 &amp; predator game viewing, but also hosts a large portion of the Great Wildebeest Migration – one of nature’s greatest spectacles.

#### Stay
Small &amp; intimate, Mbono Tented Camp has only 6 classic en-suite tents, offering a tremendous feeling of privacy &amp; seclusion.
Each luxury tent is tastefully decorated &amp; features an extended outdoor canvas roof, creating a ‘patio’ with safari chairs where lazy afternoons can be spent.
The main tent comprises an inviting living &amp; dining area under canvas, with unmatched views of the Serengeti landscape.

#### Activities
Since each group is assigned a private safari vehicle &amp; guide, guests can explore the bush at their own pace.
Safari activities at Mbono Tented Camp include open 4x4 game drives &amp; guided walking safaris where guests will learn about the local fauna &amp; flora.
