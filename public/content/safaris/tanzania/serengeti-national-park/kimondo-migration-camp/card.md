# Kimondo Migration Camp
## Serengeti National Park
### Kimondo Migration Camp

#### Experience
Kimondo Migration Camp, as the name suggests – moves periodically in pursuit of one of the most iconic wildlife spectacles on Planet Earth:  The Great Wildebeest Migration.  
Between July to November, the camp is pitched in the famous Lamai Wedge of the northern Serengeti before moving south to Kusini between December &amp; March.  
The Lamai Wedge is located between the Mara River &amp; the Kenyan border, ensuring quality wildlife viewing.  In the south, Kimondo boasts spectacular views over a popular waterhole.
Because of its seasonal ever-moving nature, guests will be right in the middle of all the action – be that mating, river crossings &amp; even birthing.

#### Stay
Kimondo Migration Camp has 9 spacious tents with breathtaking views.
Each tent features an en-suite bathroom with a hot-water bucket shower &amp; flushable toilet as well as an outdoor double shower. (There are 2 triple rooms available on request.)  Private verandas complete each tent, providing lovely views over the wilderness.
The tastefully decorated central lounge &amp; dining area provides a cosy gathering to sip a chilled glass of wine between safari activities.

#### Activities
A wide range of safari activities is available at Kimondo Migration Camp.  
These include morning &amp; evening game drives in open 4x4 safari vehicles, thrilling hot air balloon safaris over the Serengeti plains as well as visits to local villages for interesting cultural interactions.
In the northern camp, photographic safaris can also be booked – a wonderful option for nature-lovers who want to dive deeper into wildlife photography.
