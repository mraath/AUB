### Ngorongoro Sopa Lodge

#### Experience
Perched on the edge of the Ngorongoro Crater’s highest point, the superb Ngorongoro Sopa Lodge is the only property on the eastern rim of this UNESCO World Heritage Site.
The world’s largest intact &amp; unflooded caldera provides a home to a multitude of wildlife, including Africa’s Big 5 – lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo &amp; rhino.  
Sopa Lodge has a private road to the crater floor, which means that Sopa guests can avoid the early morning hustle &amp; bustle &amp; reach the crater floor faster than most.
Since the lodge faces West, glorious sunsets can be seen from the viewing deck – in fact – arguably some of the best in Tanzania!

#### Stay
Ngorongoro Sopa Lodge features 97 rooms, including 5 interconnecting rooms &amp; 1 wheelchair accessible room.
Each room has an en-suite bathroom with a spacious shower &amp; enclosed solarium offering spectacular views of the crater beyond.
The interconnecting rooms are ideal for families travelling with young children.
At the communal area, you will find a comfortable lounge, bar, restaurant, outdoor dining space &amp; swimming pool overlooking the crater.
