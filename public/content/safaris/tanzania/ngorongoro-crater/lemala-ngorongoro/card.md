## Ngorongoro Crater
### Lemala Ngorongoro

#### Experience
Set in an ancient acacia forest close to the rim of the magnificent Ngorongoro Crater, Lemala Ngorongoro Tented Camp offers an intimate &amp; secluded safari experience.
With easy access to the crater floor, Lemala guests usually have an hour’s head start over others descending the far busier road on the western rim.  This ideal location allows guests early access to the crater – crucial for photographers who demand the best light conditions.
Excellent year-round wildlife viewing can be expected as the Ngorongoro Crater is one of the best Big 5 reserves in East Africa.

#### Stay
Small &amp; intimate, there are only 9 luxury tents at Lemala Ngorongoro Tented Camp, including 1 family tent that can sleep up to 5 people.
Each tent features an en-suite bathroom, wooden floors with cosy rugs &amp; a small patio.
The mess tent hosts a communal lounge, dining area, bar &amp; library.

#### Activities
Lemala Ngorongoro includes a list of thrilling safari activities.
These include open 4x4 game drives, sundowner excursions &amp; bush lunches on the floor of the crater.
Guests can also go on tuk-tuk rides to nearby villages, visit the Maasai tribe or send their children to the Kids Club for some African-inspired fun-filled activities.
