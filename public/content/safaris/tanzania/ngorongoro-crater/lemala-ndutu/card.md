## Ngorongoro Crater
### Lemala Ndutu

#### Experience
Lemala Ndutu is a mobile tented camp that is set up between November &amp; April each year – during the best wildlife season - &amp; has been described as having the ‘ultimate front row’ seats to the Great Migration.
Each year millions of wildebeest, zebra &amp; gazelle migrate in a clockwise direction across the ecosystems of the Serengeti in Tanzania &amp; the Masai Mara in Kenya.  
Here at Lemala Ndutu, the views of the southern end of the migration route are so fantastic, you might not even have to get into a 4x4 to witness this world-renowned spectacle.  Occasionally galloping wildebeest &amp; zebra are known to pass right through camp!
During calving season (December to March), predators are frequently spotted in the area hunting for food, so if you are lucky – you might see a kill.  
The camp is unfenced to provide guests with an authentic safari experience.  (Maasai warriors guide the tents at night.)

#### Stay
Lemala Ndutu has 9 luxury tents perched on the edge of a permanent marsh, offering amphitheatre views of the Great Migration &amp; game-rich plains.
Each spacious tent has an en-suite bathroom &amp; a small wooden deck with comfortable director chairs.  Triple tents are available on request.
The communal mess tent boasts a separate lounge &amp; dining space as well as a bar &amp; campfire where pre-dinner drinks &amp; canapes are enjoyed.

#### Activities
Lemala Ndutu includes a list of thrilling safari activities.
These include open 4x4 game drives, hot air balloon safaris, sundowner excursions &amp; bush lunches on the floor of the crater.
Guests can also go on tuk-tuk rides to nearby villages, visit the Maasai tribe or send their children to the Kids Club for some African-inspired fun-filled activities.
