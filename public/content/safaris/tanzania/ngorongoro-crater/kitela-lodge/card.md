Each cottage boasts an en-suite bathroom with a bathtub &amp; shower as well as a private terrace or balcony overlooking the lush greenery of the garden or plantation.

#### Activities
Kitela Lodge activities include crater tours, guided walks &amp; excursions to Lake Eyasi where guests can meet the Hadzabe &amp; Datoga tribes.
