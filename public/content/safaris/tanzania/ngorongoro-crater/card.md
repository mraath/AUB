### Ngorongoro Crater

#### Experience
Ngorongoro Crater, situated in northern Tanzania, is an ancient volcanic caldera known for providing some of East Africa's easiest &amp most rewarding game viewing experiences.
This area is home to the sought-after Big 5 – lions, leopards, elephants, buffaloes, &amp rhinos. Ngorongoro Crater offers an exceptional safari adventure with its unique setting &amp a remarkable population of 30,000 animals, making it a dream destination for safari enthusiasts.
The landscape is nothing short of spectacular, teeming with abundant predators. It's not uncommon to spot all members of the Big 5 in a single day here.
Luxurious lodges situated atop cliffs on the rim of Ngorongoro Crater provide some of the world's most breathtaking views. Staying near the rim also has the added perk of being first in line for the descent to the crater floor each morning, allowing you to beat the crowds.
For travelers seeking more budget-friendly yet equally peaceful safari accommodations, the nearby town of Karatu, about 20 km south of the crater in the lush hills of the Karatu Highlands, offers excellent options. Many lodgings here are surrounded by working coffee plantations, offering a wide range of activities, similar to those at the crater rim.

#### Activities
Ngorongoro Crater offers a wealth of activities for its visitors. Choices include open 4x4 game drives, guided walks with Maasai warriors, mountain biking, bird watching, cultural visits, hot air balloon safaris, picnics on the crater floor, &amp romantic sundowner excursions. Day trips to nearby attractions like Lake Manyara &amp Olduvai Gorge can also be arranged.

#### When to travel
Wildlife remains within the steep-walled crater throughout the year, ensuring a great safari experience regardless of the season. High visitor numbers are expected during the peak season from July to September &amp again during the calving season in December to February following the November rains. With fewer visitors &amp a lush green landscape compared to the dry season, the April to May rainy season is often considered the best time to visit Ngorongoro Crater.
