Entamanu Private Camp offers an unmatched, exclusive safari experience at the edge of the crater’s rim at roughly 3,000 feet above sea level.

The game viewing here is exceptional!  Being one of the most densely populated conservation areas in Africa, with over 25,000 animals residing in the caldera, guests can anticipate seeing the Big 5 as well as a variety of other wildlife.  
At Entamanu Private Camp, guests will have uninterrupted views of the Serengeti to the west &amp; the Crater to the east.

The main lodge with lounge, dining area &amp; bar boasts a spectacular position on the remote north-western edge of the crater rim, affording views over either side of the crater wall.
