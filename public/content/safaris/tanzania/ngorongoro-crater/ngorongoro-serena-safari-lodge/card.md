## Ngorongoro Crater
### Ngorongoro Serena Safari Lodge

#### Experience
Ngorongoro Serena Safari Lodge enjoys a spectacular location on the edge of the world’s largest intact &amp; unflooded caldera – the famous Ngorongoro Crater in Tanzania.
Inspired by cave paintings of Olduvai Gorge, the décor &amp; interiors resemble Africa in every way.  Even the lodge exterior is built from natural stone, giving it a cave-like appearance.
Excellent year-round wildlife viewing can be anticipated, as well as historical &amp; cultural tours to nearby Olduvai Gorge or one of the local Maasai villages.

#### Stay
Ngorongoro Serena Safari Lodge comprises 75 rock-built rooms (including 1 suite) with private stone balconies offering panoramic views overlooking the crater. 
Each room is centrally heated &amp; has an en-suite bathroom.  The suite is larger than the standard rooms &amp; also includes a sitting area.
The lodge’s main area includes a quirky lounge &amp; bar as well as an open veranda with lush garden views.  There is also a beautiful rim-flow swimming pool &amp; small curio shop.

#### Activities
Guests can enjoy game drives on the crater floor or enjoy hikes &amp; picnics across the Serengeti plains or volcanic mountains of the Crater Highlands.
Other activities include historical tours to Olduvai Gorge &amp; cultural excursions to a local Maasai village.  
Post-safari herbal massages can also be booked.
