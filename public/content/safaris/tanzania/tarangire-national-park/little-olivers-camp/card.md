## Tarangire National Park
### Little Oliver's Camp

#### Experience
Little Oliver’s Camp is situated in the secluded south-eastern sector of Tarangire National Park, just downstream from its famous sister, Oliver’s Camp.
Truly authentic, the camp is set in a remote, uncrowded sector of the park, offering guests that sought-after off-the-beaten-track safari experience.
Little Oliver’s overlooks a floodplain of the Minyonyo Pools that form part of the Tarangire River system, attracting a wealth of predators as well as large herds of buffaloes &amp; elephants.

#### Stay
Small &amp; intimate, Little Oliver’s Camp can be booked on a room-by-room basis – or if families or friends would like to have sole use of the camp, they can book it exclusively.
The camp boasts 5 thatched en-suite tents, all with sensational views over the plains.  One of the tents can be made into a triple on request.  
Each tent features an indoor &amp; outdoor shower, offering great views of the surrounding landscape.
The large mess area at Little Oliver’s Camp houses an elegantly furnished lounge &amp; dining area that leads out onto the front deck &amp; outdoor fireplace where guests can enjoy pre-dinner drinks or gaze up at the canopy of stars.

#### Activities
A range of exciting safari activities is available at Little Oliver’s Camp.
These include open 4x4 day &amp; night drives with qualified guides, guided walking safaris &amp; thrilling hot air balloon safaris over the vast African plains.
