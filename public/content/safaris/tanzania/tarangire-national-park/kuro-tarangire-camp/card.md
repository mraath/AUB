# Kuro Tarangire Camp
## Tarangire National Park
### Kuro Tarangire Camp

#### Experience
Kuro Tarangire is named after the life-giving Tarangire River &amp; discreetly tucked into a grove of secluded riverine bush in its namesake’s National Park.
It is not uncommon for elephants to pass right through the camp on their way to the Sllale Swamp to drink &amp; play.  In fact, Tarangire is renowned for its massive herds of elephants &amp; buffaloes that often attract hungry predators on the prowl for food.
This back-to-basics tented safari camp allows guests to immerse themselves in nature with as few distractions as possible.
Kuro Tarangire Camp limits the game drive vehicles to only 6 guests at a time, ensuring an authentic &amp; intimate safari experience.

#### Stay
Accommodation comprises 6 Meru-style safari tents &amp; 1 two-bedroom family unit, all resting among the trees with views over the African bush.
Each stylish tent features an en-suite bathroom with a bucket shower &amp; flushing toilet.  
The family unit consists of 2 en-suite bedrooms, connected by a canvas corridor that zips closed at night.  This unit is ideal for families with younger children who want access to mum &amp; dad after dark, without the need to head outside.
The main lodge features a lounge, dining area, bar &amp; library.

#### Activities
Safari activities at Kuro Tarangire Camp include day &amp; night game drives in open 4x4 vehicles, guided walking safaris, bird watching, romantic sundowner excursions &amp; bush dinners.
