# Lemala Mpingo Ridge
## Tarangire National Park
### Lemala Mpingo Ridge

#### Experience
Perched on top of a cliff with jaw-dropping views over the Tarangire River, lies the beautiful Lemala Mpingo Ridge.
In dry season – between June &amp; October, this water source becomes a drawcard to Tarangire National Park’s large herds of buffalo, elephant &amp; giraffe – a wonderful sight to behold.
Tarangire may not be as well known as the iconic Serengeti &amp; Ngorongoro Crater but offers an intimate &amp; unspoilt safari experience.  The park is famed for its tree-climbing lions, big herds of elephants &amp; the unusual long-necked gerenuk.  
It is also a bird lover’s paradise since there are over 550 species recorded - &amp; the best place in northern Tanzania to photograph striking baobabs – Africa’s unique ‘upside-down tree.’

#### Stay
Accommodation comprises 10 luxury tents, 3 family tents &amp; 1 two-bedroom tent, all perfectly positioned to maximize the amazing views.
Each luxury tent features an en-suite bathroom, a private viewing deck with sunken outdoor lounges that convert to comfortable day beds &amp; a private outdoor bathtub.
The en-suite family tents sleep a maximum of 4 people &amp; are identical to the luxury tents but have a sofa bed to accommodate triples &amp; a safari-style Kids bed for children under 12.
Ideal for families or friends travelling together, the two-bedroom tent is generously sized, with each en-suite bedroom affording sensational views &amp; a shared lounge.  This unit can sleep 6 guests. 
Mpingo Ridge’s elevated main area is sheltered by granite boulders &amp; offers breathtaking views over the Tarangire River &amp; valley below.  Guest areas include a comfortable lounge &amp; dining room, safari bar, sparkling swimming pool, library, Kids Club &amp; spa.

#### Activities
Safari activities at Lemala Mpingo Ridge include day &amp; night game drives, hot air balloon safaris, canoeing on Lake Manyara &amp; tuk-tuk village visits.  Guests can also enjoy picnics on the floor of the Ngorongoro Crater or send their little ones off to the Kids Club for fun-filled activities.
