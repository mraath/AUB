#### Experience
Escarpment Luxury Lodge boasts a beautiful setting on the edge of Lake Manyara &amp; offers glorious views over the lake &amp; national park.
This slice of paradise offers nature enthusiasts a crowd-free, tranquil safari experience as well as spectacular surroundings.
Escarpment Luxury Lodge’s elevated position among the trees is ideal for bird watching, so guests are introduced to Lake Manyara’s bird list of 400 species from the comfort of the viewing deck.

The lodge offers 16 luxurious appointed private suites, offering single, double &amp; triple occupancy.  All suites are positioned on raised wooden decks, providing spectacular views over the bush.
Each suite has a private deck to take in the magnificent sight of Lake Manyara &amp; wildlife passing through the lodge grounds.  Abundant bird life fills the trees and bushes growing directly around the decks of each suite, affording the sense of complete immersion with nature.
The main lodge hosts a dining &amp; lounge area with spectacular lake &amp; park views as well as a sparkling swimming pool where relaxing afternoons can be spent sipping on a G&amp;T.  Dinners are usually served in the open dining area overlooking the lake or out in the bush under a canopy of stars.
