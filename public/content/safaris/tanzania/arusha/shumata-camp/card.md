### Shu'Mata Camp

#### Experience
Set on a craggy hill at the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro in the heart of the Maasai Steppe, Shu’Mata Camp is an intimate safari haven, offering awe-inspiring views of the south Amboseli savanna &amp; Africa’s highest mountain.
Shu’Mata means ‘heaven’ in the local Maa language - &amp; aptly so – because it is so close to Kilimanjaro that on a clear night, guests might see details of its glaciers at the summit, which is the highest in all of Africa.
This luxurious tented camp is situated in a private concession that is home to an abundance of wildlife like giraffe, wildebeest, eland &amp; zebra as well as a variety of bird species.  South Amboseli is also famed for its large herds of elephants.

#### Stay
There are 7 Hemingway-style safari tents at Shu’Mata, all perched on top of a hill offering breathtaking views over Mount Kilimanjaro &amp; the surrounding savanna.
Each luxury tent boasts an en-suite bathroom with an open-air shower &amp; a private veranda with open fire &amp; safari chairs.
The communal tent features a lounge &amp; dining area, a bar &amp; a large terrace with gorgeous views.

#### Activities
A wide range of exciting activities is available at Shu’Mata Camp.
These include open 4x4 game drives in the Greater Kilimanjaro &amp; Amboseli region, night drives in search of nocturnal animals, walks with Maasai guides &amp; climbing Mount Kili to the Shira Plateau at 4,000 meters in altitude.
