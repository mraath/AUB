# Jongomero Camp
## Ruaha National Park
### Jongomero Camp

#### Experience
Situated on the banks of the seasonal Sand River in a remote corner of Ruaha National Park, lies Jongomero Camp – a luxury tented haven &amp; the only camp in the entire area.
Utterly remote, Jongomero Camp is an ideal choice for romantics in search of an authentic &amp; private tented safari experience.
Not only can guests expect to see Ruaha’s abundant wildlife – including lion, leopard, elephant &amp; buffalo – but also enjoy excellent bird watching as well as photographic safaris.

#### Stay
The camp is tucked away below a riverine canopy on the banks of the Jongormero Sand River, a natural pathway for animals in search of water.
Accommodation comprises 8 large &amp; well-appointed tented suites, built on raised wooden platforms under enormous, thatched roofs.  
Each tented suite features an en-suite bathroom &amp; private veranda which overlooks the riverbed.
Positioned on one of the meanders with sweeping views of the bank beyond lies the camp bar, lounge, library &amp; restaurant.

#### Activities
Daily morning &amp; afternoon game drives in open-sided 4x4 vehicles are led by qualified guides.  
Exploring the bush on foot to learn more about local fauna &amp; flora is another exciting activity on the safari menu.
Adventurous guests can also book a fly-camping experience where they will head off on a walking safari &amp; spend the night in mobile dome tents under a canopy of stars.
