### Jabali Ridge

#### Experience
Jabali Ridge, a sophisticated retreat with awe-inspiring views, is set on the banks of the Mwagusi River in the northern area of Ruaha National Park in Tanzania.
Famed for being one of Ruaha’s most luxurious lodges, Jabali Ridge will exceed even the highest expectations.
Its well-placed location in one of the least visited but most exciting conservation areas in Tanzania make for action-packed &amp; thrilling wildlife encounters.  
Ruaha is home to some of Africa’s largest concentrations of elephants, buffaloes &amp; predators such as lion &amp; leopard.

#### Stay
Luxurious, small &amp; intimate – Jabali Ridge comprises only 10 suites including a family suite. (children over 12 are welcome)  
Each sophisticated suite boasts jaw-dropping views over Ruaha from every corner of the room – be it from the bed, the desk, or the bathroom.  Louvred shutters can be opened completely, blurring the lines between indoor &amp; out, or closed for privacy.  
Each en-suite bathroom has a rain shower &amp; the private decks offer uninterrupted views over the stunning landscape beyond.
Communal areas include a large lounge, dining space, bar &amp; spa as well as an infinity pool overlooking the bush.

#### Activities
Daily morning &amp; afternoon game drives in open-sided 4x4 vehicles are led by qualified guides.  Guests will also be able to enjoy action-packed night drives, searching for nocturnal animals with a spotlight.
Exploring the bush on foot to learn more about local fauna &amp; flora is another exciting activity on the safari menu.
