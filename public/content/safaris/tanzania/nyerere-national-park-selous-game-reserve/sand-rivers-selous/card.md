#### Experience
Set on a rocky hill with breathtaking views over the Rufiji River in Nyerere National Park (Selous Game Reserve), lies an intimate safari retreat called Sand Rivers Selous.
Luxurious in style, yet classic in nature – the camp is an ideal choice for travellers looking for a stylish yet authentic safari experience.
The Nyerere National Park - a World Heritage Site - hosts a large diversity of wildlife &amp; birds, including lion, leopard, wild dog, elephant, buffalo, hippo &amp; crocodile.

#### Stay
There are 5 riverfront suites &amp; 3 hilltop suites at Sand Rivers Selous.
The riverfront suites are perched on the edge of the Rufiji River, all open-fronted &amp; en-suite.  
Natural materials like stone, wood &amp; thatch were used to blend in with the beautiful landscape.  Each open-fronted suite allows guests to feel part of nature &amp; even at times get the odd visitor – a squirrel or a monkey.
The hilltop suites are set up on the hillside, but still offer views over the Rufiji River.  These open-fronted suites have an extra sitting area &amp; private plunge pool.

#### Activities
A variety of thrilling safari activities are available at Sand Rivers Selous.
These include open 4x4 game drives with a qualified guide, guided hikes, boating safaris on the river as well as exciting fly-camping adventures.
