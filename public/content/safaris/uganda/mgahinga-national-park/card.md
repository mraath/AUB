### Mgahinga National Park

#### Experience
Mgahinga National Park, also known as Mgahinga Gorilla National Park, is one of only 2 places in Uganda that is home to the critically endangered mountain gorilla &amp has become a bucket list destination that is well worth a visit.
The local word, ‘gahinga’, refers to the array of volcanic rock found dotted around the various bases of the park’s 3 extinct volcanoes, making it a unique destination for volcano enthusiasts.
Forming part of the Virunga Conservation Area that straddles Rwanda and the DRC, the park is famous for its once-in-a-lifetime gorilla trekking safaris &amp breathtaking landscape – including volcanoes, forests, crater lakes &amp swamps.
Although Mgahinga is Uganda’s smallest national park, an impressive amount of birds can be seen here, along with an array of other wildlife, including the rare golden monkey, blue monkey, leopard, bushbuck, duiker &amp golden cat. Rare golden monkey sightings are a special treat for visitors.

#### Activities
Activities at Mgahinga National Park include gorilla trekking safaris, nature trails, mountain climbing expeditions, bird watching &amp cultural encounters with the local Batwa people. Any of the 3 volcanoes can be climbed in a day.
Guests can also visit the quaint market town of Kisoro that is located only 15km away, adding a touch of local culture to their adventure.

#### When to travel
Mgahinga Gorilla National Park is open for gorilla trekking the whole year, but the best time is during the drier seasons from June to September &amp December to February.
