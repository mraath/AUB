### Bwindi Impenetrable National Park

#### Experience
Gorilla Trekking Safaris Uganda: Encounter mountain gorillas in their natural habitat in Bwindi Impenetrable Forest.
Bwindi Impenetrable Park is an ancient, deep forest situated along the southwestern border of Uganda.
Breathtakingly beautiful, the forest is not only a UNESCO World Heritage Site but is home to half the world’s remaining population of endangered mountain gorillas. Out of these, several families have become habituated to humans, allowing intimate groups of trekkers to spend an hour in their company under the supervision of expert guides.
Set against the slopes of a mountain range, the forest offers a wealth of biodiversity, including forest elephants, giant forest hogs &amp hundreds of butterflies. Several types of primates also roam beneath the thick canopy of trees.
Over &amp above gorilla trekking safaris, Bwindi also offers guests the rare opportunity to be part of the Gorilla Habituation Experience – the slow &amp gentle introduction of a family of wild gorillas to the presence of humans. This means that trekkers can have more time with the gorillas while contributing to conservation.

#### Activities
Apart from trekking endangered mountain gorillas in Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, other exciting activities are also offered, including hiking, bird watching &amp meeting the local Batwa people – an interesting cultural experience.

#### When to travel
Bwindi is open for gorilla trekking all year long, but the best times to go are from June to September &amp December to February. At these times, the forest trails are drier &amp therefore less slippery. Also, your chance of a dry gorilla viewing experience is higher during these months.
Gorilla treks can be physically challenging, especially during Uganda’s rainy seasons, which are from March to May &amp then again in October &amp November.
Depending on the gorilla’s last location, the trek can take anywhere between 40 minutes to 6 hours, after which guests will be able to spend time with the gorillas for 1 hour.
