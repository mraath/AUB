## Uganda
### Queen Elizabeth National Park

#### Experience
Yes, Uganda is famous for its exciting gorilla trekking safaris that are on everyone’s bucket list, but the country also offers a blend of classic savanna safaris &amp memorable forest-based chimpanzee trekking safaris, both of which can be found in the game-rich Queen Elizabeth National Park – Uganda’s premier game viewing destination.
The park is located within the southwest of the country &amp is one of the most biologically diverse parks in the world, with an impressive bird list of 610 recorded species – more than the British Isles!
Its biggest drawcard though is the iconic tree-climbing lions – a rare habit of lions - that can only be seen in 2 African destinations: Lake Manyara in Tanzania &amp Queen Elizabeth National Park in Uganda. These lions climb trees to have a better vantage point for spotting the various prey that can be seen loitering around the park. These big cats can easily pounce on their food without easily being noticed. They also climb trees to escape the heat from the ground &amp get shelter from the rain.
Apart from the fact that Queen Elizabeth National Park offers the perfect blend between a classic savanna style safari &amp a chimpanzee trekking safari in the silver forest of Kyambura Gorge, the park’s real reward lies in its ability to offer a diverse range of safari activities.

#### Activities
Boat cruises along the Kazinga Channel is usually a highlight, given the rewarding game viewing &amp bird watching en-route, while Kyambura Gorge offers a lush green forest to explore, home to chimpanzees &amp other primates. Savanna game viewing activities include open 4x4 drives while chimpanzee trekking safaris are on foot – an exciting contrast &amp a wonderful way to connect with Uganda’s fauna &amp flora.

#### When to travel
Queen Elizabeth National Park is open all year long, but wildlife viewing is at its best during the dry seasons from January to February &amp June to September. However, this scenic park is at its most beautiful in the wet seasons from March to May &amp October to December when bird watching is at its best.
