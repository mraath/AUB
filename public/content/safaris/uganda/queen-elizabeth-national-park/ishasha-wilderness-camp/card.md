### Ishasha Wilderness Camp

#### Experience
Ishasha Wilderness Camp enjoys a remote setting on the banks of the Ntungwe River in the southern sector of Queen Elizabeth National Park.
This intimate tented camp is ideal for romantics looking for a peaceful stay or nature lovers who appreciate an off-the-beaten-track experience.

#### Stay
Ishasha Wilderness Camp has 10 framed, spacious canvas tents, set in a wooded area beside the Ntungwe River.  Each tent is comfortably furnished, with an en-suite bathroom &amp; spacious outdoor patio.
The lodge’s central area features a bar that overlooks the river as well as a boutique shop – one of the few in Uganda that accepts credit cards, so there is no limit to your shopping!
Meals can be enjoyed in the main dining room, under a canvas roof or alfresco under the stars.  Locally sourced ingredients are used to provide a delicious, wholesome food experience.

#### Activities
Guests can set out on game drives to search for the famous tree-climbing lions, or enjoy day trips to Lake George’s floodplains &amp; Kazinga village where some of the villagers will share some of their customs &amp; culture.
Bird watching is also popular since the region is home to 610 species of birds.  The park also hosts one of the largest hippo populations, so guests are almost guaranteed to spend time with these river-loving creatures.
