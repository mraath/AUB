#### Experience
Turaco Treetops Lodge is a luxury lodge set in the lush rainforest neighbouring Uganda’s Kibale National Park.  
With uninterrupted views over the snow-capped Rwenzori Mountains &amp; Kibale Forest, Turaco Treetops Lodge is the ideal place to immerse yourself in nature &amp; experience an Uganda safari of note.
Turaco’s location sets a precedent for wonderful chimpanzee encounters, with a 90% success rate of seeing the primate up close in Kibale Forest National Park.  Other animals that can be seen include bush babies, black &amp; white colobus monkeys &amp; the great blue turaco bird.

#### Stay
Constructed on stilts, Turaco’s 8 luxury forest cottages are set deep within the forest, hidden between the Kibale treetops.  
These upscale treehouse-styled cottages include en-suite bathrooms &amp; private viewing decks with breathtaking views over the forest.  This is the ideal spot to relax on a sun lounger &amp; watch as the monkeys &amp; birds play in the greenery.
The main building features a bar, a wood-burning fireplace for chilly winter evenings &amp; a cosy elevated lounge boasting incredible views of the surrounding landscape.  
There is also a large swimming pool as well as an indoor &amp; outdoor children’s play area.

#### Activities
Guests staying at Turaco Treetops Lodge can explore the rainforest on foot, go on a birding tour or view the volcanic-induced crater lakes via hiking or mountain biking.
