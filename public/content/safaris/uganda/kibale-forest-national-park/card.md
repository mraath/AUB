### Kibale Forest National Park

#### Experience
The 80,000-hectare Kibale Forest Park is not only home to Africa’s highest density &amp highest diversity of primates – including the endangered chimpanzee, red colobus monkey &amp L’Hoest’s monkey - but is also one of the last expanses of land in Uganda to boast both lowland &amp montane forest.
Forest cover, interspersed with patches of grassland &amp swamp, dominates the northern &amp central parts of the park on an elevated plateau, offering a diverse landscape for visitors to explore.
Kibale Forest National Park is linked to the game-rich Queen Elizabeth National Park by a wildlife corridor, where herds of elephants freely roam between both sanctuaries, providing a unique opportunity to witness these magnificent creatures in their natural habitat.
Although the biggest drawcard to Kibale Forest is, undoubtedly its primates, the park is also home to a variety of other animals such as African golden cat, serval, leopard, buffalo, duiker &amp bushpig. Bird watching is also great – there are 370 recorded species found here, making it a birdwatcher's paradise.
Visitors to Kibale should not leave before they sample a fresh cup of coffee made from the park’s wild Robusta coffee tree, providing a unique Kibale Forest coffee experience.

#### Activities
Kibale Forest National Park offers a range of exciting activities.
These include chimpanzee trekking safaris, hiking, bird watching &amp strolling along the cultural trails with stops at Batooro &amp Bakiga villages that are located at the outskirts of the park, providing an enriching cultural experience.

#### When to travel
Kibale is open for chimpanzee trekking throughout the year.
December to February &amp June to September are the driest months &amp are therefore the best times for this activity, offering the most favorable conditions.
Walking the trails is easier at this time &amp the overall experience tends to be more enjoyable for those seeking a memorable primate encounter or bird watching in Kibale.
