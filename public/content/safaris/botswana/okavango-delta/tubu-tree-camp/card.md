# Tubu Tree Camp
## Okavango Delta
### Tubu Tree Camp

#### Experience
Tubu Tree Camp is located on Hunda Island, the largest area of permanently dry land in the Okavango Delta.  The diverse habitats, including mopane, riverine forest &amp; dry Kalahari sandveld allow for diverse &amp; spectacular wildlife viewing.
Because the camp is situated in an area with the most palatable grasses, animals flock here daily &amp; often guests can experience fantastic plains game viewing from the main viewing deck.

#### Stay
Tubu Tree Camp is built in traditional style &amp; consists of only 6 double tents, all raised on wooden platforms overlooking the picturesque vistas of the Okavango Delta’s floodplains.  There is also 1 honeymoon tent &amp; 1 family unit, consisting of 2 en-suite bedrooms with adjoining lounge.  
Each tent has an en-suite bathroom &amp; outdoor shower for those wishing to enjoy feeling close to nature.  
The main area features a dining, lounge &amp; pool area – also on raised platforms &amp; facilitating the beautiful views of Botswana’s bushveld.  

The camp’s most well-known feature is the outdoor bar area which lies under the canopy of a large marula tree.  Days are often spent sipping on a cocktail overlooking the unique scenery of the Okavango Delta.

#### Activities
Year-round day &amp; night drives are conducted in open 4x4 safari vehicles.  
Wildlife seen around Tubu Tree Camp includes elephant, lion, zebra, giraffe, wildebeest as well as kudu, impala &amp; bushbuck.  The area also enjoys frequent visits of the resident leopards.  Water activities are on request during winter.
The variety of birdlife is impressive, with dry-land species seen on the large islands &amp; wetland birds seen on the floodplains &amp; waterways of the Okavango Delta.
