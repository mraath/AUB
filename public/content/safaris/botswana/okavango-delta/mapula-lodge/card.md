# Mapula Lodge
## Okavango Delta
### Mapula Lodge

#### Experience
Mapula Lodge is set within an enormous 90,000 hectares Okavango Delta private concession that is a matrix of floodplains, woodlands &amp; channels.
This iconic Delta landscape is a magical environment in which to enjoy the abundance of wildlife Botswana has to offer.  
Mapula Lodge is one of only a handful of camps in the concession, making for exhilarating game viewing in a blissfully uncrowded area.

#### Stay
Mapula Lodge only has 8 luxury cottages, built from thatch &amp; canvas.  There is also 1 family suite, consisting of 2 adjoining rooms to accommodate families with children.  The rooms consist of 1 king bed &amp; 2 single beds.
Each luxury cottage has an en-suite bathroom, with indoor &amp; outdoor showers.
Mapulaâ€™s main area comprises a communal dining area, bar &amp; swimming pool where guests can relax &amp; cool off between safari activities.

#### Activities
A good luxury Botswana safari includes both land &amp; water activities.  
At Mapula Lodge, guests can enjoy the best of both worlds.  Activities include open 4x4 game drives, night drives looking for nocturnal animals, mokoro safaris in dug-out canoes as well as catch &amp; release fishing.
