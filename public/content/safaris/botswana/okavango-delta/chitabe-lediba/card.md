# Chitabe Lediba
## Okavango Delta
### Chitabe Lediba

#### Experience
Chitabe Lediba neighbours the Moremi Game Reserve in the Okavango Delta, Botswana.  The Chitabe Concession consists of 28, 000 hectares of some of Botswana’s most diverse habitats, from savanna to tree-filled islands &amp; floodplains.  
The camp is set in the same area as its sister camp, Chitabe Camp – so wildlife viewing will be identical.  
Because the camp has a stunning vantage over a small lagoon that has become a water hole, guests can expect to see a multitude of wildlife from the comfort of the camp itself.

#### Stay
Smaller than its sister camp, Chitabe Lediba offers a more intimate safari experience – ideal for small groups or families.  The camp has 5 luxurious tents, each equipped with an en-suite bathroom &amp; a romantic outdoor shower.
Two of these tents are ideal for families since they are connected to form a family unit, with 2 en-suite bathrooms.
Chitabe Lediba has a dining area, lounge &amp; pool with breathtaking views over the small lediba (lagoon that has become a water hole), after which the camp is named.

#### Activities
Camp activities include morning &amp; afternoon game drives in open 4x4 safari vehicles.  
Afternoon drives normally return after dark so that guests can see some of the shyer nocturnal animals such as civet, genet, serval, porcupine &amp; on the rare occasion, aardwolf.  
Chitabe Lediba is also famous for its 2 elevated platforms which can be utilized as a game viewing platform by day.  Walking safaris are also offered.
