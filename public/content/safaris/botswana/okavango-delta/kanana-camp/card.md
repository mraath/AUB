# Kanana Camp
## Okavango Delta
### Kanana Camp

#### Experience
Kanana Camp is located on the Xudum River in the southwest of the Okavango Delta.  The area is home to a myriad of animals, birds &amp; plants – the perfect place to experience the diversity of species found in the Okavango Delta.
The word Kanana means ‘paradise’ in the local language &amp; it is not surprising to see why.  Set in idyllic surrounds amongst fig &amp; palm trees, Kanana overlooks the beautiful waterways of the Okavango Delta’s seasonal floodplains.

#### Stay
Guests are accommodated in 9 luxury tents &amp; 4 standard tents.  All Meru-style tents are well spaced, ensuring absolute privacy in a relaxed &amp; pristine bush setting.  Each tent has en-suite facilities with double vanities, a romantic outdoor shower, a large viewing deck &amp; secluded views.
 The main area consists of 2 chill-out areas with sofas &amp; comfortable seating as well as a bar, dining room, pool, curio shop, jetty &amp; an open-air boma area where guests can enjoy dining under the stars right next to the water.

#### Activities
The annual floods transform this dry camp into a true water experience, offering guests the best of both worlds.  
Activities at Kanana Camp include morning &amp; evening game drives in open 4x4 safari vehicles, boating trips, glass-bottomed mokoro safaris in dug-out canoes, fishing in summer, guided walks &amp; sleeping under the stars in one of their romantic Sleep-Out Decks.
