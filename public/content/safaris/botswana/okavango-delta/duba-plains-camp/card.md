# Duba Plains Camp
## Okavango Delta
### Duba Plains Camp

#### Experience
Located on a tree-covered island in a 30,000-hectare private concession in the Okavango Delta, Duba Plains Camp is one of the most remote camps in Botswana.  
Found &amp; designed by Derek &amp; Beverly Joubert, National Geographic filmmakers, conservationists &amp; explorers, the camp is famous for its access to the constant struggle between lion &amp; buffalo.  It is not surprising that they have chosen Duba Plains for their home base.
Great Plains Conservation is the only operator on the concession, thereby offering guests the ultimate opportunity for private wildlife sightings.
Many consider Duba Plains to be the Okavango’s Maasai Mara because of the sheer volume of wildlife.  Spending a few nights at Duba Plains will allow guests the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see lions on the prowl while tracking down an enormous herd of buffalo.

#### Stay
The camp consists of 5 traditional-style tents with en-suite bathrooms, outside showers &amp; verandas with panoramic views of the Okavango Delta floodplains.  
The thatched main area consists of a lounge, dining &amp; bar area raised along with the pool on wooden platforms with the purpose in mind of maximizing the gorgeous views.  There is also a Kids Club to keep the young ones entertained.

#### Activities
Duba Plains Camp allows guests the opportunity to explore the bush &amp; its surroundings on open 4x4 Land Rover safaris.  Professional guides will accompany guests &amp; track down some of Africa’s wildest &amp; most interesting animals.
Nature walks are also possible.  Experiencing the bush on foot is an interesting way of seeing Botswana from a different angle.  Motorized boating is seasonal &amp; available between May &amp; October.
Apart from the lion &amp; buffalo interaction, the concession is also famous for its herds of elephant feeding on the islands &amp; hippo chilling out in the Okavango Delta’s cool water channels.
