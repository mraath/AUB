### Sanctuary Stanley's Camp

#### Experience
Sanctuary Stanley’s Camp has a prime location in a 260,000-hectare private concession, bordering the southern section of the world-renowned Moremi Game Reserve in Botswana.
The camp offers year-round access to the Okavango Delta, the world’s largest inland delta – ensuring a game-packed African safari.
The different seasons in Botswana allows the camp to take on various colours throughout the year – from lush green in the rainy season to dry savannah in the warmer summer months.

#### Stay
Sanctuary Stanley’s Camp is a classic tented camp with only 10 luxury canvas tents built around a large sausage tree overlooking the Okavango floodplains.  All tents include en-suite bathrooms, handcrafted beds, antique furniture &amp; oriental carpets.  Large wooden decks provide private areas for guests to relax in hammocks while enjoying their morning coffee or pre-dinner drinks.
This intimate camp is gathered around a large sitting &amp; dining area, which affords magnificent views over the Okavango Delta’s floodplains.  Giraffe &amp; other plains game can be watched from the lodge’s swimming pool as they march across the savannah.

#### Activities
A variety of activities are included at Sanctuary Stanley’s Camp.  Open 4x4 game drives will ensure close encounters with Africa’s wildest predators &amp; mokoro trips in dug-out canoes will take you on a breathtaking journey through the waterways of the Okavango Delta.  
Guided nature walks &amp; scenic helicopter flights are also available.
A highlight to most guests is the leisurely walk with 2 semi-habituated elephants, Jabu &amp; Morula.  Guests can interact with &amp; feed the elephants &amp; even enjoy a picnic lunch in their company.
