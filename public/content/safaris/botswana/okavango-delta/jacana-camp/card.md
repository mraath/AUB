# Jacana Camp
## Okavango Delta
### Jacana Camp

#### Experience
Jacana Camp is situated on a small island in a scenic private concession called Jao, in the heart of the Okavango Delta, bordering the Moremi Game Reserve.
This beautiful island setting allows for year-round water activities &amp; gorgeous views over the Okavango Delta’s water channels &amp; lagoons.

#### Stay
Jacana Camp offers guests an intimate safari experience in the lap of luxury, &amp; consists of only 5 Meru-style tents built on raised wooden decks overlooking the gorgeous Okavango Delta.  
Each tent has an en-suite bathroom with a roofless shower where guests can view the magnificent starry skies at night.
The main lodge consists of a dining room, bar &amp; lounge area set between 2 large fig trees &amp; surrounded by wild date palms.  Jacana Camp’s most prominent feature is the open fire under the stars as well as a plunge pool for cooling off after a day out in the warm African sun.

#### Activities
Daily activities include year-round mokoro trips, boating safaris &amp; guided walking safaris.  Guests will also have an opportunity to view wildlife from the Jao Concession’s 2 platform hides.
Land-based game drives are offered when the inundation levels are lower, typically in the summer months.
Because Jacana Camp is set in a game-packed area of the Okavango Delta, larger animals such as elephant, lion, leopard &amp; buffalo can often be seen here.  Birdlife in the Jao Concession is fantastic year-round.
