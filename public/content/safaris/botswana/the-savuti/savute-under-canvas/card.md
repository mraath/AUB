There is also a communal guest area with comfortable sofas where guests can relax after a day in the African bush, or enjoy pre-dinner drinks &amp; watch the sunset.  Personal butler services are also available.

#### Activities
Twice daily open 4x4 game drives will allow for close encounters with some of Africa’s most interesting animals.  This game-rich area of the Chobe National Park usually offers excellent predator sightings, including big lion prides.
