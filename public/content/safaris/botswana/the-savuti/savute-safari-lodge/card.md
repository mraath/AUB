### Savute Safari Lodge

#### Experience
Located on the banks of the Savute Channel in the heart of the Chobe National Park, Savute Safari Lodge is an intimate safari lodge, accommodating only 24 guests in cool thatched timber &amp; glass suites.
The area is renowned for the unique interaction of the resident predator species &amp; herds of bull elephants.  The lodge offers privacy, luxury &amp; magnificent views over Africa’s wilderness.
Because Savute Safari Lodge overlooks both the Savute channel &amp; a natural waterhole, fantastic game viewing opportunities are available from your private viewing deck. This area is packed with wildlife, especially in the dry summer months when some of Africa’s wildest animals migrate to these water sources.

#### Stay
The 11 suites are designed to bring guests back to nature &amp; modern African décor contributes to the overall style of the lodge.  Each suite has a private deck, combined bedroom &amp; sitting area as well as en-suite facilities. 
There is also a 2-bedroom family suite with en-suite bathrooms raised on an expansive deck.
The sitting area, library &amp; cocktail bar are situated in an exquisite thatch and timber main building.  Savute Safari Lodge boasts a viewing deck, an alfresco dining area &amp; a swimming pool – which is ideal for watching game at the waterhole.

#### Activities
Open 4x4 game drives are conducted in the Savute area, including the famous Savute Marsh, and the ancient San rock paintings at Gubatsa Hills add magic to a delightful African safari.
