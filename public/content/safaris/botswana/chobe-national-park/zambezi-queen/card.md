## Chobe National Park
### Zambezi Queen

#### Experience
The Zambezi Queen is a luxury houseboat based on the Chobe River in Botswana, but it is officially a joint Namibian &amp; Botswana property as the river forms the boundary between these two countries.
A unique &amp; elegant experience, The Zambezi Queen will take you on a journey through some of Africa’s most beautiful &amp; scenic regions.

#### Stay
The first &amp; second levels of the boat consist of 14 cabins – all equipped with private balconies.  The cabins have been tastefully furnished with either a double or 2 single beds.  Of these 14 suites, 4 are master suites, some with private outdoor areas.  
The main areas of the boat feature a living &amp; dining area as well as a stunning pool deck, the ideal place to cool off while reading a book or watch nearby animals in their natural environment.

#### Activities
The Zambezi Queen offers a variety of activities from the boat as well as the surrounding areas.  Game viewing in smaller boats will enable close encounters &amp; wonderful photo opportunities.
Tiger &amp; bream fishing in season are also available.  Bird lovers will be delighted to know that they can tick off their list from the privacy of these smaller boats.
Open 4x4 game viewing &amp; cultural visits to nearby villages will give guests the chance to explore the local region by jeep or on foot.  Aerial helicopter sightings are on offer at an additional cost.
