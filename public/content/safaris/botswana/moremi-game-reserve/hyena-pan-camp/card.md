### Hyena Pan Camp

#### Experience
Hyena Pan Camp boasts a remarkable location in the 200,000-hectare Khwai Private Reserve next to the only permanent water source for miles around, ensuring top-notch wildlife viewing from the comfort of your viewing deck.
Due to the camp’s lagoon-front location, it is a magnet for predators &amp; other wildlife, including elephant, buffalo &amp; hordes of plains game.

#### Stay
With only 8 beautifully appointed spacious tents, Hyena Pan Camp offers guests an intimate, comfortable &amp; welcoming safari experience.  Each tent is equipped with en-suite facilities &amp; solar-powered lighting to keep things eco-friendly.  
The camp’s main area consists of a dining deck, lounge &amp; swimming pool overlooking an active waterhole where plenty of animal activity takes place.  After the sun has set, the waterhole is illuminated so that guests can still enjoy the magic of the bush after dark.

#### Activities
The camp offers open 4x4 game drives, a ground-level hide that is a favourite amongst photographers &amp; an open-air boma where guests can relax around a crackling fire.
