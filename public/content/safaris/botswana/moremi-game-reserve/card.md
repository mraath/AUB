### Moremi Game Reserve

#### Experience
Protecting 3,000 square km of the central &amp eastern Okavango Delta, Moremi is a stunning blend of lily-covered wetlands, sparkling floodplains, open grassland &amp dappled forests, offering guests a beautiful contrast between permanent water &amp dry land. For a Chief’s Island luxury safari experience guide, look no further than Moremi Game Reserve.
Home to the famous Chief’s Island – Botswana’s best wildlife destination – it is not surprising that travelers from across the globe prefer to add the Moremi Game Reserve to their bucket list.
Here, guests will experience action-packed wildlife encounters, phenomenal predator sightings &amp great bird watching on the lagoons.

#### Activities
Visitors to the Moremi Game Reserve will have their pick from a wide selection of exciting safari activities.
These include open 4x4 game drives, bush walks, boating safaris, mokoro trips in traditional dug-out canoes &amp even fishing.
Accommodation should be chosen carefully because some lodges offer land-based activities while others offer water-based activities. A handful of lodges offer both. It is important to stay at a mix of lodges where guests can explore all the activities Moremi has to offer, including photographic retreats in Moremi Game Reserve's diverse landscapes.

#### When to travel
The Moremi has 3 distinct safari seasons. The best time to travel is during high season - between July &amp October - when large herds of wildlife concentrate along the waterways of the Okavango Delta. (Botswana receives its water from the highlands of Angola almost 2,000km away, &amp it only reaches the Okavango floodplains 6 months after the last rains have fallen there.) For unique safari experiences in Moremi Game Reserve wetlands, consider traveling during the green season, between December to March, when the bush is lush &amp birdlife is amazing. During the rainy season, rates are at their lowest.
