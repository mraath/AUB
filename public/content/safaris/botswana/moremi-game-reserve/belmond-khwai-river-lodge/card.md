The camp consists of 14 luxury en-suite tents, all housed on wooden stilts, offering magnificent views &amp; gorgeous sunsets.  The large private decks are furnished with hammocks &amp; easy chairs, ideal for relaxing &amp; watching wildlife.  
There is also an exclusive private suite with a spacious deck, set away from the other rooms to ensure the utmost privacy.  
Each tent or suite boasts an open-air double shower &amp; deep copper-framed Victorian bath, with only the tree canopy as a roof, allowing guests to further commune with nature.
The camp’s heated swimming pool is perfect for cooling off after a day out in the sun &amp; the open campfire is a popular place to gather under the beautiful African sky.

#### Activities
