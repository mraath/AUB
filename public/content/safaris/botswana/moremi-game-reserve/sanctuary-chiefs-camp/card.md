### Sanctuary Chief's Camp

#### Experience
Sanctuary Chief’s Camp is tucked away in the Mombo Concession, part of the world-renowned Moremi Game Reserve in the heart of the Okavango Delta of Botswana.
Known as the ‘predator capital of Africa,’ this area is also home to large herds of elephants &amp; buffaloes, making Chief’s Camp the ideal place to experience Africa’s wildlife at its best.

#### Stay
Accommodation consists of 10 stylish air-conditioned bush pavilions, specially designed with ultimate luxury &amp; privacy in mind.  These spacious pavilions each have a thatched roof &amp; include a large sitting area, en-suite bathroom as well as indoor &amp; outdoor shower.  
Game viewing can be enjoyed from the privacy of your private pavilion as each large viewing deck looks out over the floodplains where animals are often spotted.  
There is also a communal decked living room with magnificent views, while the dining area surrounds a fire pit on the very edge of the plains so that guests can continue their game viewing while enjoying fine cuisine &amp; wine. 
This is Botswana safari luxury at its best!

#### Activities
Sanctuary Chief’s Camp provides close encounters with Africa’s most prolific predators on open 4x4 game drives &amp; also offers a water experience in dug-out canoes (mokoros).
