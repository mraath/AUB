# Mombo Camp
## Moremi Game Reserve
### Mombo Camp

#### Experience
Mombo Camp is located within the Mombo Concession on the tip of Chief’s Island within the Okavango Delta’s Moremi Game Reserve.
Everyone knows that this area boasts enormous concentrations of plains game &amp; predators – providing the best game viewing in all of Africa.  Black &amp; white rhino have been reintroduced to the region, so guests have the privilege of seeing the Big 5 up, close &amp; personal.

#### Stay
The camp is built under large, shady trees overlooking the game-packed floodplains.  
Mombo Camp comprises 9 luxurious tents, each with an en-suite bathroom, private plunge pool as well as indoor &amp; outdoor shower.  Two of these tents make up a 2-bedroom family unit.
The main living &amp; dining areas are under thatch, but a traditional open-air boma allows for an outdoor dining experience of note.  In the main area, you will find a bar, pool, gym &amp; library.

#### Activities
Your first game viewing experience starts on the viewing deck at Mombo Camp, where wonderful concentrations of game can be seen right in front of the camp.  It is not strange to find animals wandering past, sometimes right under the guests’ rooms.
Mombo Camp offers morning &amp; afternoon game drives in open 4x4 safari vehicles.  The seats are slightly elevated, providing unobstructed views of Africa’s wildlife.  Lion sightings are frequent.  
Guests can also expect to see leopard, wild dog, spotted hyena, large herds of buffalo, elephant, white rhino, giraffe, wildebeest &amp; zebra.
