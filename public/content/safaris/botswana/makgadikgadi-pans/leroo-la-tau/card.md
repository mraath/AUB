### Leroo La Tau

#### Experience
Leroo La Tau is situated in the Makgadikgadi Pans National Park.  Raised majestically above the Boteti River, guests have an opportunity to view the bush from an elevated platform, allowing for unobstructed views of Africa’s wildlife.
The park, populated by up to 30,000 zebra and wildebeest closely accompanied by predators, offers guests the chance to experience the exhilaration of seeing large concentrations of game &amp; the resultant predator interaction.

#### Stay
Leroo La Tau offers 12 thatched chalets overlooking the Makgadikgadi Pans National Park, each with beautiful en-suite bathrooms.  The main lodge offers a dining room, reading room &amp; bar as well as expansive wooden decks &amp; plunge pool – perfect for cooling off after a day out.  
The lodge also boasts a raised hide above the river where guests can enjoy spectacular wildlife sightings.  The hide is an ideal place to relax or simply read a book while listening to the sounds of the wild.

#### Activities
Safari day &amp; night drives are conducted in open 4x4 vehicles.  Guests will be accompanied by a qualified guide who will share his expert knowledge of the bush &amp; its animals.  Upon return to the lodge, guests can enjoy a relaxing dinner &amp; retire to a cosy fireplace overlooking the river.
