# Dinaka Camp
## The Kalahari
### Dinaka Camp

#### Experience
Dinaka Camp is located on an exclusive conservancy in the northern edge of the Kalahari Game Reserve &amp; home to one of the most unique bio-diversities in Southern Africa.
Home to the Kalahari lion, springbok, oryx &amp; brown hyena, this ever-changing desert landscape never fails to impress.  
During the annual summer rains, the arid desert landscape is transformed into a lush green belt of vegetation, offering guests insight into the lesser-known desert experience.

#### Stay
The camp boasts 7 spacious double thatched safari tents, each with an en-suite bathroom, walk-in shower &amp; outdoor shower with a view.  Dinaka’s 2-bedroom thatched tent with a shared en-suite bathroom is ideal for families with young children.
All tents are well spaced &amp; raised on wooden decks, providing the perfect vantage point over a permanent waterhole.  
The main area includes a dining room, bar sitting area, campfire with waterhole views &amp; star deck for outside dining.
The Sleep-Out Deck allows guests to spend the night under the magnificent African night sky – a truly magical experience!

#### Activities
The focus at Dinaka Camp is on morning &amp; evening game drives in open safari vehicles, with night drives heading out into the darkness with a spotlight looking for nocturnal animals.  
Educational walks with Bushmen are also offered, allowing guests to have insight into this ancient culture, their survival techniques &amp; historic way of life.
