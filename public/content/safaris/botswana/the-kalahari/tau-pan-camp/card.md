# Tau Pan Camp
## The Kalahari
### Tau Pan Camp

#### Experience
The vast &amp; unspoiled Central Kalahari Game Reserve is the largest sand basin in the world &amp; home to the beautiful Tau Pan Camp.  
The camp has a unique location overlooking a salt pan &amp; the endless Kalahari horizon, giving it a unique sense of space that is different to any other area in Botswana.

#### Stay
There are 9 environmentally designed thatched units built on raised decks overlooking the famous Tau Pan, offering incredible views from the ridge of an ancient sand dune, an unusual experience in a land as flat as Botswana.  
One of these rooms includes an additional twin bedroom, ideal for family use.  Each thatch unit has an en-suite bathroom with an indoor &amp; outdoor shower.
This 100% solar-powered camp consists of a main area with lounge, dining room &amp; large viewing deck with boma, where nights are often spent around the fire, under the stars.

#### Activities
Guests travelling to this area will be delighted to know that remote safari drives are available in open 4x4 vehicles.  Nature walks &amp; star gazing are also part of the program.  
Experiencing the reserve on foot with a San Bushman tracker often leaves an ever-lasting impression.
