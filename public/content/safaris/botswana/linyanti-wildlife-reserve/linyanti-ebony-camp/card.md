# Linyanti Ebony Camp
## Linyanti Wildlife Reserve
### Linyanti Ebony Camp

#### Experience
Linyanti Ebony Camp is set in a private concession on the banks of the Linyanti Marsh, adjacent to its sister, Linyanti Bush Camp.  
Because the marshes are the only water source for miles around, the camp experiences a fantastic variety of wildlife making their way to camp in search of water.

#### Stay
Linyanti Ebony Camp is small &amp; consists of only 4 spacious en-suite safari tents, all built on elevated decks ensuring stunning views of the endless vistas &amp; lagoons of the Linyanti River system.  One of these 4 tents consists of 2-bedrooms, &amp; is ideal for families travelling with small children.  
The campsâ€™ main area includes a dining &amp; lounge area looking out over a sparkling swimming pool.  For large groups or families, Linyanti Ebony &amp; Linyanti Bush Camps can be booked together on request for groups of up to 20 people.

#### Activities
A safari to Botswana is not complete without experiencing both land &amp; water activities.  Linyanti Ebony Camp offers both, including open game drives in 4x4 safari vehicles, walking excursions with a qualified guide as well as boating &amp; mokoro trips on the waterways of the beautiful Okavango Delta.  Fishing can also be enjoyed.
Because the camp is set in a private concession, off-road driving is permitted which means that animals can be followed for miles on end.  Nocturnal animals are frequently spotted on night drives.
