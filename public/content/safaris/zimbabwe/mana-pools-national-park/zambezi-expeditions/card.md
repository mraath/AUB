## Mana Pools National Park
### Zambezi Expeditions

#### Experience
The semi-permanent Zambezi Expeditions is a tented camp (only open from May to October) in the heart of Mana Pools National Park.
Small &amp; intimate, Zambezi Expeditions is the ultimate safari destination for adventure-seeking travellers looking for an authentic, back-to-basics safari experience with a little bit of luxury.
The national park has an abundance of wildlife – elephant, wild dog, waterbuck, buffalo &amp; lion.  
What makes this camp so special, is that there are no set itineraries.  Each day is flexible &amp; planned to guests’ wishes.

#### Stay
There are 6 Meru-style canvas tents set along the Zambezi River, each with an en-suite bathroom including bucket shower &amp; flush toilet, taking guests back to a bygone era of the original expedition camps.
The main area includes a communal tent with lounge &amp; dining areas.

#### Activities
Guests staying at Zambezi Expeditions have a variety of exciting land &amp; water safari activities to enjoy.  
These include looking for animals in open 4x4 safari drives, exploring the bush on foot with a qualified guide as well as paddling down the river in a canoe.
Fishing is also available.
