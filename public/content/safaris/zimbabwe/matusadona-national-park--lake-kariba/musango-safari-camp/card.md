# Musango Safari Camp
## Matusadona National Park & Lake Kariba
### Musango Safari Camp

#### Experience
For off-the-beaten-track travellers, there is no place like Musango Safari Camp.  
Situated a short flight away from Victoria Falls, the camp is set on a private island deep within Zimbabwe’s wilderness, overlooking the waters of Lake Kariba.
Bordering Matusadona National Park – one of the wildest &amp; least visited reserves in Zimbabwe – Musango ticks every list on the off-the-beaten-track list.
Surrounded by rugged mountains &amp; riverside trees, matched by the quality of wildlife viewing – this is big game country where elephant, buffalo &amp; hippo pass by camp &amp; where lions, hyenas &amp; leopards fill the night with their calls.

#### Stay
Musango Safari Camps boasts 6 tented chalets &amp; 2 honeymoon suites, all offering breathtaking views over Lake Kariba.
Each tented chalet is spacious &amp; features a stone-built en-suite bathroom.  The 2 honeymoon suites offer the utmost privacy &amp; include secluded verandas &amp; private plunge pools.
The double-story central lodge area comprises a comfortable lounge, a bar with a built-in plunge pool as well as a large viewing deck.

#### Activities
Musango offers their guests a wide variety of safari activities, including open 4x4 game drives, boating safaris on the lake, village visits where guests can learn more about local life &amp; guided walking safaris.
Other exciting activities include rhino tracking, birding, canoeing &amp; Tiger-fishing.
