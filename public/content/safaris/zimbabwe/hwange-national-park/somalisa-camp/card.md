### Somalisa Camp

#### Experience
The award-winning Somalisa Camp is a stylish tented safari camp that lies in Zimbabwe’s flagship Hwange National Park &amp; overlooks a busy waterhole.
The camp is built along the Kennedy vlei line, which means guests can expect plenty of wildlife action on game drives.
Hwange National Park offers superb year-round game viewing with frequent sightings of lion, elephant &amp; white rhino as well as a wide variety of antelope.  Excellent birding can also be expected as well as fantastic photographic opportunities.
Overlooking a busy elephant drinking waterhole, Somalisa guests can have an ‘armchair’ experience from the comfort of the camps’ viewing deck or swimming pool.

#### Stay
Remote &amp; romantic, there are only 7 customised tents, each with a private viewing deck, luxurious en-suite bathroom &amp; lounge as well as a glass wood-burning fireplace for chilly winter evenings.
Somalisa is a leading eco-friendly safari lodge using solar-powered energy &amp; a water recycling plant.

#### Activities
Safari activities at Somalisa Camp include big game safaris in open 4x4 vehicles, guided walking safaris, birding as well as cultural village tours &amp; game viewing from one of the many secret hides on the reserve.
