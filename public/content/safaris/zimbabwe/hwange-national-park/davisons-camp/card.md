The camp overlooks a prolific waterhole that is visible from the main area &amp; all the tents.  Guests can sit on their private deck while watching elephants drink or play in the water.  
The Linkwasha Concession offers superb year-round game viewing with frequent sightings of lion, elephant &amp; white rhino as well as a wide variety of antelope.  Excellent birding can also be expected as there are over 400 recorded species in the area.

The main area at Davison’s Camp includes a swimming pool &amp; bar where cocktails can be enjoyed.
