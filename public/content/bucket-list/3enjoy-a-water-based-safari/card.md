## Bucket List
### 3Enjoy a Water-based Safari

ENJOY A WATER-BASED SAFARI
Africa offers a wide range of exciting safari activities – but not all safaris take place on land!  Some can be enjoyed from the comfort of a canoe, a boat or even a traditional mokoro (dug-out canoe).  
Exploring Africa on a water-based safari brings you closer to aquatic animals like hippo &amp; crocodile while superb birdwatching can be enjoyed as the sun sets over the bushveld.  Elephants are frequently spotted drinking or playing in the water – an incredible sight to see!
Not many destinations in Africa offer water-based safaris, but the ones that do, are totally worth the visit!
We recommend that you combine a water safari with a land safari so that you can experience the best of both worlds.  Land-based safaris include open 4x4 game drives that will get you up, close &amp; personal with Africa’s wildest animals while water-based safaris are relaxing, memorable &amp; plenty of fun.
Get ready &amp; dive deeper with us as we explore Africa’s best water-based safari destinations.
1. Chobe River, Chobe National Park - Botswana
The Chobe River sits on the northern boundary of the famous Chobe National Park in Botswana &amp; hosts a variety of exciting water-based activities, including sunset boat cruises, game viewing cruises &amp; fishing safaris.  You can even overnight on a luxury houseboat &amp; experience the Chobe River in style.
2. Okavango Delta – Botswana
A water destination like no other, the iconic Okavango Delta is a water wonderland dotted with private islands, secret channels, open waters &amp; the predator-rich Moremi Game Reserve.  The Delta offers a year-round water safari experience, &amp; here you can explore the waterways of the Okavango Delta by traditional mokoro (dug-out canoe) or by boat.  Walking safaris are also popular &amp; some camps even offer fishing expeditions.  If you are travelling to Botswana, we’ll make sure to suggest the best combination of camps so that you can experience both land &amp; water-based activities.
3. Zambezi River, Victoria Falls – Zimbabwe or Zambia
The majestic Victoria Falls is one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World &amp; is the longest east-flowing river in Africa.  It flows through 6 countries &amp; straddles the border of Zimbabwe &amp; Zambia.  Tumbling into the mighty Zambezi River with its many adventure activities, it comes as no surprise that Victoria Falls is known as ‘Africa’s adventure capital.’  The Zambezi River offers sunset boat cruises, canoe safaris, fishing expeditions &amp; white river rafting.
4. Queen Elizabeth National Park – Uganda
Uganda is a country laden with jungles, craters &amp; national parks - &amp; is one of Africa’s top gorilla &amp; chimp trekking destinations.  Fit for royals, Queen Elizabeth National Park is home to the famous tree-climbing lions &amp; 2 large bodies of water:  Lake Edward &amp; Lake George, both connected by the Kazinga Channel – home to a diversity of wildlife.  The channel is one of the park’s main features &amp; boasts the highest concentration of hippos &amp; Nile crocodiles in the world.  These aquatic animals are frequently spotted during a boat safari or romantic sundowner cruise.
