TAKE A DIP IN A PRIVATE PLUNGE POOL
Honeymoons are all about connecting with your loved one &amp; making lasting (romantic) memories.  
Visiting Africa means that you’ll spend plenty of time in the bush or the sun, so it is important to be able to relax in style…&amp; what better way to unwind than to take a dip in a private plunge pool?
