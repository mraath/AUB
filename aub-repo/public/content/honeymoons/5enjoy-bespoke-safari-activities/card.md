ENJOY BESPOKE SAFARI ACTIVITIES
The word bespoke also means ‘custom-designed’ or ‘tailored’ &amp; here at Africa Unwind, we do exactly that.  The holidays we design are made especially for you because we are passionate about taking all your holiday needs &amp; requirements into consideration.
When it comes to a honeymoon, there is nothing more frustrating than spending most of your time with others, in large groups or stuck to a certain schedule – rather than enjoying the privacy you so deserve!
We’ll make sure that your honeymoon activities are tailored to perfection so that you can spend all your time focussing on the one you love.
Here is a list of our favourite bespoke honeymoon activities that can all be enjoyed on your own &amp; at your desired pace &amp; time.
1. Private Day Tours, Cape Town - South Africa
Cape Town is usually high up on the list when it comes to honeymoons.  There is so much to see &amp; do in &amp; around this vibrant city – from the iconic Table Mountain &amp; Boulders Beach with its adorable penguins to wining &amp; dining in the Wine Route &amp; getting pampered at a world-class spa.  Instead of booking a scheduled tour, we’ll recommend private day tours – which means that you will have a dedicated driver, guide &amp; air-conditioned vehicle &amp; can explore the city at your own pace.
2. Exclusive Safari Drives - Safaris
Most lodges in Africa have a maximum policy of 10 guests per safari vehicle, but when you are on honeymoon &amp; require a little more privacy, exclusive use of a vehicle is high on the list.  When you have a private ranger, tracker &amp; vehicle, you can come &amp; go as you wish &amp; spend more time at a great sighting.  Of course, it does come at an additional cost, but if privacy is truly what you are after – it is worth every cent.
3. Private Candle-lit Dinners – Islands
Romantic dinners are all about atmosphere &amp; location.  When you are on honeymoon, we inform the lodges &amp; resorts that you are celebrating a special occasion, so that they can go the extra mile for you.  Usually, this means a special dinner in a beautiful location – be that on your private deck while on safari, or the beach next to the ocean.  Our top pick is a candle-lit dinner on a tropical island – pretty romantic, isn’t it?
4. Couple’s Massages – Wine Route
What is more relaxing than sharing a couple’s massage with your loved one? Africa has a long list of wellness spas that will tick all the boxes when it comes to pampering.  Many safari lodges offer tranquil massages next to a waterhole, on your private deck or at the spa while most island resorts boast world-class spas overlooking the ocean.  Some of our favourite spas can be found in Cape Town &amp; the Wine Route, so make sure to add a spa day to your honeymoon itinerary.
5. The Bubble Bath Experience, Kruger National Park – South Africa
For sheer indulgence, enjoy a romantic bubble bath in the comfort of your room or tent.  Picture this:  a sunken bath set on a secluded platform in the heart of the bushveld, as you relax by candlelight while enjoying a chilled glass of wine.  Some of our favourite bathtubs can be found in the Kruger’s Private Reserve in South Africa.  You’re on honeymoon, so leave it to us – we’ll arrange a romantic turn-down &amp; Bubble Bath Experience for you.
