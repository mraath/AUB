INDULGE IN ROMANCE
A honeymoon is the cherry on top when it comes to romantic travel - &amp; in Africa, you will find romance around every corner.
Luxurious suites, discreet service &amp; outdoor showers coupled with spectacular wildlife, uninterrupted views &amp; pristine beaches, put Africa on the map as one of the best honeymoon destinations in the world.
It is not surprising then, to find romance everywhere you go.  Not only is Africa’s lodges luxurious beyond your imagination, but the experiences &amp; activities she offers is special, memorable &amp; unique.
Whatever you need for your honeymoon, we can probably make it happen!  Be it private helicopter flights, romantic candle-lit dinners on the beach, exclusive safari drives or turn-down service with a twist – Africa will surprise you around every corner.
We have thought long &amp; hard about the best ways to indulge in romance, so get ready to start dreaming.
1. Sleep in a treehouse – See our Top Picks
What is more romantic than spending the night under a canopy of stars &amp; listening to the sounds of the wild?  We have compiled a list of our favourite treehouse stays, so if it is romance you are after, look no further.  
2. Enjoy a candle-lit dinner on the beach - Islands
Spending your honeymoon on an island in the Indian Ocean means that you will have direct beach access, which only means one thing:  romantic dinners with your feet in the sand.  Eating fresh seafood while listening to the sound of the ocean is simply put – magical.  
3. Surprise her with a private sundowner excursion – Kruger’s Private Reserves
Kruger National Park’s safari lodges are great at arranging exclusive sundowner excursions for special occasions – like a honeymoon.  Go on an afternoon game drive, get dropped off at a remote location in the bush &amp; enjoy romantic sundowners with your spouse. (accompanied by a discreet member of staff who will look after your safety)
4. Treat yourselves to a couples’ massage – Cape Town
There are many amazing spas in Africa, so you can get pampered while on safari, on an island or in a city.  Some of our favourite spas are found in the vibrant city of Cape Town, so make sure to add a few nights in the Mother City before or after your safari honeymoon.
5.  Taste good food &amp; wine – Wine Route
When it comes to exceptional food &amp; wine, look no further than the famous Wine Route in South Africa.  Known as the country’s gourmet capital, this iconic route – made up of the lovely towns of Franschhoek, Stellenbosch &amp; Paarl - boasts award-winning fine dining restaurants, farm-to-table cuisine &amp; superb wines.  Romance is not complete without good food (&amp; wine)!
6. Go on a romantic sunset boat cruise – Chobe National Park
There is something magical about watching the sun sets over the horizon.  And in Africa, there are plenty!  You can witness beautiful sunsets from anywhere in Africa, but one of our favourite ‘sunset’ destinations, is from a boat on the Chobe River.  Sipping on a G&amp;T while seeing hippos &amp; elephants play in the water, is very special.  For those wishing to soak up more time on the Chobe River, try staying on a luxurious houseboat!  The Zambezi Queen or Chobe Princess are both great choices.
7. Experience a night of stargazing - Namibia
When it comes to stargazing, Namibia is the cherry on top!  Since most camps boast remote settings surrounded by desert &amp; stars – this is the best place to enjoy uninterrupted views over the Milky Way.  Some camps also offer star bed sleepouts – the perfect choice for a honeymoon.
