#### When to travel
Despite its central location within Rwanda, Kigali boasts a temperate climate, thanks to its high elevation. The weather can vary slightly depending on the season.
Throughout the year, you can expect daytime temperatures in Kigali to range between 25°C &amp 27°C (77°F to 81°F), with evening lows of 14°C to 16°C (57°F to 61°F).

Similar to other cities in East Africa, Kigali experiences two wet seasons: the long rains &amp short rains. The long rainy season spans from March to May, with occasional showers possible in January &amp February. The short rainy season unfolds in October &amp November, with December often witnessing a bit of rain as well.
During the wet seasons, Kigali doesn't receive continuous rainfall throughout the day. There are moments when the sun graces the city. The hilly terrain of Kigali &amp  the surrounding countryside provide a cooler climate with slight variations compared to the flatter, lower-altitude regions.
