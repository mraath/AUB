### Magashi Camp

#### Experience
Magashi Camp boasts a spectacular setting overlooking the scenic Lake Rwanyakazinga in the only exclusive-use area of Rwanda’s triumphant Akagera National Park.
Lake Rwanyakazinga is home to one of Africa’s highest densities of hippo &amp; thanks to successful wildlife restoration operations &amp; strict anti-poaching laws, Akagera has become the biggest protected wetland in Central Africa.  
Once again home to the Big 5, Akagera is also one of the best birding areas in the world, with 500 recorded species, including the perplexing stork-like shoebill (also known as whale head).

#### Stay
Magashi Camp includes 6 spacious &amp; airy canvas tents, offering uninterrupted views over Lake Rwanyakazinga.  Each tent has en-suite facilities with an indoor shower &amp; separate toilet.
The tents are connected to the main area by elevated wooden walkways.  The main area comprises a luxurious lounge, dining area, bar &amp; pool as well as an expansive viewing deck with a fire pit.

#### Activities
Safari activities at Magashi are ample.  Boat safaris on Lake Rwanyakanzinga is an excellent way to view the area’s aquatic animals &amp; water birds while thrilling game drives &amp; night drives will enable guests to view predators &amp; other land animals.  
Guided walking safaris &amp; catch-&amp;-release fishing throughout the year are also on offer.  
A Big 5 safari in Akagera National Park combines easily with a once-in-a-lifetime gorilla-trekking adventure in Rwanda’s Volcanoes National Park.
