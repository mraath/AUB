### Camp Kalahari

#### Experience
Camp Kalahari is an authentic tented safari camp, located in the magnificent Makgadikgadi Pans area of Botswana.
Camp Kalahari offers travellers a more affordable alternative to its luxurious sister camps:  Jack’s Camp &amp; San Camp.  The best time to visit is during the wet season when guests will have a good opportunity to see the zebra &amp; wildebeest migration as well as flamingos in their hundreds.

#### Stay
The lodge consists of 12 comfortable Meru-styled tents – each equipped with an en-suite bathroom.  Two of these tents make up a family tent, comprising of 2 bedrooms &amp; a joined bathroom.  Each tent is furnished with rich textiles, Moroccan kilims &amp; four-poster beds.
The main area features a traditional thatched lounge, library, dining room &amp; sparkling swimming pool for cooling off on warm summer days.

#### Activities
Activities offered from Camp Kalahari include open 4x4 safari drives in the Makgadikgadi National Park as well as spot-lit night drives. A real highlight is spending time with the resident meerkats, a truly remarkable experience.  
Quad bike trips to the Ntwetwe Pan is a great way to explore the area &amp; guests can also visit Chapman’s Boabab – a true historic gem of Botswana.
Guests can also spend time walking with a group of Zu/’hoasi Bushmen for a glimpse into their ancient culture or even enjoy horse-back safaris like the earliest explorers.
