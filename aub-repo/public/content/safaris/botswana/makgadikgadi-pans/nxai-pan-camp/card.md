### Nxai Pan Camp

#### Experience
Nxai Pan Camp is located in the wildlife-rich Nxai Pan National Park, a unique reserve encompassing a fossilized lakebed &amp; the famous Baines’ Baobabs.
Here, in the remote corners of Botswana, a unique mix of savannah &amp; Kalahari species can be found.  The biggest draw to the park is during summer when zebras migrate by the thousands to the area to drop their young – the second-largest land animal migration in Southern Africa.

#### Stay
The camp is located on the western edge of the fossil pan from which the camp takes its name.  
With spectacular views over the open grasslands of the pans, 9 environmentally designed en-suite rooms offer guests excellent game viewing opportunities from the comfort of their room.  One of these rooms includes an additional twin bedroom for family use.
The main camp area consists of a lounge, dining room &amp; viewing deck overlooking the permanent waterhole which draws a multitude of mammal species.

#### Activities
Daily activities include game drives in open 4x4 safari vehicles, exciting nature walks &amp; trips to see the famous Baines’ Baobabs.  Stargazing is also possible. 
Due to the large populations of antelope in the area, predators are never too far behind.  Guests can expect to see lion, cheetah, jackal, hyena, leopard &amp; rare wild dog.
