### Little Machaba

#### Experience
Little Machaba is situated in the wildlife-rich Khwai concession in the northeast Okavango adjacent to the Moremi Reserve.  
The camp is located on the same island as its sister camp - Machaba Camp but is run separately.  Guests staying at Little Machaba will enjoy a luxury Botswana safari in a 1950’s style setting.
Little Machaba is the epitome of an intimate &amp; personal safari experience.

#### Stay
Little Machaba boasts only 4 luxury tents, bringing the maximum capacity at camp to only 8 guests.  This camp set-up promises an intimate, luxury Botswana safari experience – &amp; also enables guests to book the entire camp exclusively so that their group or family can have a luxury safari experience of note.
The tents are built on raised decks that are linked to a pathway that winds through the riverine trees.  Each classic tent has an en-suite bathroom, patio deck &amp; relaxation area as well as a romantic outdoor bathtub &amp; shower.

#### Activities
Exciting safari activities at Little Machaba includes open 4x4 morning &amp; evening game drives as well as walking safaris where guests will learn about smaller animals, plants &amp; animal tracks.
A Botswana safari highlight remains to explore the waterways of the Okavango Delta in dug-out mokoros in search of wildlife &amp; birds.
