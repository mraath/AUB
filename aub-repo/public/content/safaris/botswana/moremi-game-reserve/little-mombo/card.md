# Little Mombo
## Moremi Game Reserve
### Little Mombo

#### Experience
Little Mombo is located on the famous Chief’s Island in the Moremi Wildlife Reserve in Botswana.  The camp is built under a shady canopy of jackalberry &amp; sausage trees &amp; shares the same island as its sister camp, Mombo, overlooking a floodplain that is host to an astonishing variety of wildlife.
Due to the abundance of wildlife frequently seen here, the Mombo wildlife area has been given the name “Place of Plenty.”  It is also home to the Botswana Rhino Reintroduction Project.
Little Mombo is the epitome of a premier Botswana safari experience where luxury &amp; amazing wildlife viewing take centre stage.

#### Stay
This intimate, premier camp boasts only 4 luxury suites tucked away under a shady canopy of jackalberry &amp; sausage trees, overlooking a floodplain regularly visited by herds of herbivores &amp; their predators.
Each suite is designed with luxury in mind &amp; enjoys spectacular views over the floodplains, huge four-poster bed, en-suite bathroom, outdoor shower &amp; private sala for midday siestas.
The main area includes a dining room, bar &amp; lounge.  Little Mombo shares a spa, gym &amp; lap pool with Mombo.

#### Activities
Everything at Little Mombo is about the wildlife.  Game drives via open 4x4 Land Rovers each accommodate a maximum of 4 guests, allowing each guest a ‘window’ seat.
