### Moremi Crossing

#### Experience
Moremi Crossing is a luxury tented camp built on a palm-fringed island surrounded by the Moremi’s game-rich seasonal floodplains &amp; overlooking Chief’s Island.  
The eco-friendly camp combines luxury with simplicity &amp; boasts spectacular views over the Boro River onto Chief’s Island.

#### Stay
Accommodation consists of 16 en-suite spacious tents on raised decks, each with an eco-friendly shower heated by solar power &amp; veranda overlooking the bush.  There is also a 2-bedroom family tent &amp; a honeymoon tent with a romantic outdoor bath.
Moremi Crossing’s crescent-shaped main area consists of a large open plan deck looking out over the Boro River &amp; Chief’s Island.  
There is also a dining room, bar &amp; lounge as well as various small private lounge areas, created with privacy in mind.

#### Activities
Moremi Crossing is a classic water-based safari camp, where guests can explore the wilderness from a traditional mokoro canoe or motorboat.  Watching the sunset while drifting along a lagoon, sipping sundowners, is the perfect way to end a day.
Walking safaris are also available for those wishing to learn more about animal tracks, flora &amp; smaller animals.
