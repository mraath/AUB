### Camp Moremi

#### Experience
Peering out beneath giant ebony trees, Camp Moremi is situated on the magnificent Xaxanaka Lagoon in the heart of the Moremi Wildlife Reserve within the Okavango Delta.
This area is known to have the best game viewing in Botswana, with superb predator sightings &amp; excellent year-round birding.

#### Stay
Camp Moremi provides only 11 African-style safari tents, each individually sited on a raised teak platform with private adjacent facilities &amp; viewing deck, most offering unsurpassed views of the Xakanaxa Lagoon.  
There is also a luxury family safari tent, consisting of 2 separate bedrooms, 2 bathrooms &amp; a private deck with beautiful views over the Moremi Game Reserve.  All tents are en-suite.
An elegant, elevated thatch &amp; timber structure serves as the main building comprising a main sitting area, wildlife reference library, dining room and cocktail bar - inviting a true sense of the African wilderness. 
Other facilities include a secluded swimming pool with sundeck &amp; thatched boma where brunch and high tea are served.

#### Activities
Safari activities consist of morning &amp; late afternoon game drives in open 4x4 vehicles, offering frequent sightings of lion, leopard, cheetah &amp; wild dog.  Guests can also explore the Xaxanaka Lagoon &amp; surrounding Okavango channels by motorboat.
