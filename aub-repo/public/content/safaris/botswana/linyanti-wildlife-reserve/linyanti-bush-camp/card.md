#### Experience
Linyanti Bush Camp is situated on the banks of the Linyanti Marsh in a private reserve, which borders the western boundary of Chobe in the Chobe Enclave.  
Being the only water source for miles around, the marshes attract water-adapted &amp; desert-adapted wildlife, including large populations of elephants &amp; buffaloes.  The area also offers spectacular birding all year round.

Linyanti Bush Camp consists of 6 luxury tents, each with en-suite facilities, sofa &amp; writing desk.  The tents are all positioned to offer spectacular views of the Linyanti Marsh, ensuring an up, close &amp; personal encounter with Africa’s wildest animals.
The main lodge area is a large open-sided canvas tent raised on wooden decking with a dining room, bar &amp; lounge, with comfortable sofas.  
The deck ensures unobstructed views over the Linyanti floodplains &amp; marsh where large herds of elephants &amp; buffaloes are often seen.

#### Activities
Activities at Linyanti Bush Camp include open 4x4 game drives, motorboating, mokoro trips, nature walks &amp; fishing.  Off-road driving is allowed in the concession, so guests can follow the animals for miles on end – ensuring an excellent safari experience.
Night drives are also available where guests can search for the shyer nocturnal animals with the use of a spotlight.  Frequent sightings of lion, leopard, wild dog, hippo, &amp; crocodile can be expected.
