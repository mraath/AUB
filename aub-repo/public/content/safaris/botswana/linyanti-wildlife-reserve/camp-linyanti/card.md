# Camp Linyanti
## Linyanti Wildlife Reserve
### Camp Linyanti

#### Experience
Camp Linyanti is a water wonderland & located in the uncrowded north-western corner of Chobe National Park.  
The camp is all about offering guests a raw safari experience, so guests who favour safari quality over luxury accommodation will feel right at home.

#### Stay
A safari to Camp Linyanti is small & intimate.  There are only 5 Meru-style safari tents with elevated wooden decks, allowing only a maximum of 10 guests in camp at a time.  One of these tents is ideal for honeymooners looking for a bit more privacy.
Each tent has an en-suite bathroom with an outdoor shower, as well as a lounge area & deck with beautiful views over the bush.

#### Activities
A safari to Camp Linyanti offers a unique, uncrowded wildlife experience.  Twice daily game drives are conducted in open safari vehicles.  
Birding enthusiasts will be delighted to know that during their stay at Camp Linyanti they will be able to tick off a variety of birds from their list.
