## Linyanti Wildlife Reserve
### King's Pool

#### Experience
King’s Pool is set in the beautiful Linyanti Wildlife Reserve in the northern part of Botswana.  The Linyanti Reserve is a private concession located on the western boundary of the Chobe National Park, ensuring spectacular wildlife viewing.
What makes King’s Pool great, is the camp’s unique location on the banks of the Linyanti River.  Excellent game viewing can be experienced around the riverbed, allowing guests to sit on the deck while enjoying wildlife activity in or around the river.

#### Stay
King’s Pool has 7 luxurious canvas tents as well as a 2-bedroom suite, ideal for families.  Each tent is equipped with a bedroom, lounge, private plunge pool &amp; sala.  A lovely touch in the en-suite bathrooms is the double showers &amp; hand-basins, as well as an outdoor shower for those who wish to get close to nature.
The main area is on expansive raised decks.  For dining under the stars, there is an open-air boma where stories of the day can be shared around a crackling fire.  The camp also has a communal pool for cooling off after a day out in the African sun.

#### Activities
Famous for its large elephant population, the Linyanti Wildlife Reserve never disappoints.  An abundance of wildlife is found in this part of the Chobe National Park &amp; guests can expect to see lion, leopard, cheetah, wild dog &amp; spotted hyena on open 4x4 game drives.   Bush walks are also available.
A wonderful way of taking in all Botswana has to offer, is to sit on the water’s edge while watching elephants in action.  The camp also has 2 hides where guests can sit &amp; relax or have a siesta while elephant trunks swing by.
