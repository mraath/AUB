# Savuti Camp
## Linyanti Wildlife Reserve
### Savuti Camp

#### Experience
Set in an isolated part of the Linyanti Concession along the Savute Channel, Savuti Camp has an ideal location – 17 kilometres downstream from the Zibadianja Lagoon, the source of the Savute Channel.  
The Channel stopped flowing between 1980 &amp; 2008; during this time it served as a corridor &amp; feeding ground for a wide variety of herbivores.  In 2008, the Savute Channel once more became a deep, clear waterway for animals to congregate &amp; drink, thus ensuring an abundance of game surrounding the camp &amp; front row seats for Savuti’s guests.

#### Stay
Accommodation consists of 5 large walk-in tents, raised off the ground &amp; facing the Savute Channel.  All tents are spacious &amp; have en-suite bathrooms.  There is also an additional family tent, consisting of 2 inter-leading bedrooms, each with bathroom &amp; private entrance.
The main area includes a plunge pool, thatched dining area &amp; large viewing deck with boma, providing a breathtaking view of the teeming Savute Channel.

#### Activities
Day &amp; night drives are available at Savuti Camp, allowing guests to explore the bush in sunlight as well as at night.  Night drives are focused on searching for nocturnal animals with a spotlight.  Nature walks with a guide are on request &amp; several well-positioned hides make it easy for up-close &amp; personal wildlife viewing.  
Plains game &amp; species such as roan &amp; sable antelope, southern giraffe, lion, leopard, cheetah, spotted hyaena, black-backed jackal &amp;wild dog may also be encountered.  Wintertime is great to see the sought-after aardvark &amp; aardwolf.
