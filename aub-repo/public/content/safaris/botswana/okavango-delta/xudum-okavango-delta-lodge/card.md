#### Experience
Xudum Okavango Delta Lodge is located to the southeast of the Moremi Game Reserve in the centre of the Okavango Delta.
Truly one of Botswana’s most unique safari destinations, the Okavango Delta provides excellent land &amp; water-based game viewing year-round.

#### Stay
Xudum Okavango Delta Lodge is made up of 9 stylish safari tents with beautiful views over the channels &amp; waterways from private deck areas.  Each tent has a large bathtub, outdoor shower &amp; private plunge pool.
The double volume main area is open in the front, to allow for unobstructed views over the African bushveld.  Here guests can relax in the spacious lounge &amp; dining areas with a book, a pair of binoculars or a cocktail in hand.

#### Activities
A wide variety of activities are on offer at Xudum Okavango Delta Lodge.  Open 4x4 game drives will give you private encounters with some of Africa’s big game &amp; predator species, where mokoro trips will take you on a journey through the waterways of the Okavango Delta.
Guests can also set out on foot in search of wildlife or embark on a night drive on the lookout for Botswana’s nocturnal animals.
