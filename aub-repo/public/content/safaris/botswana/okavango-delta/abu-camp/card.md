# Abu Camp
## Okavango Delta
### Abu Camp

#### Experience
Abu Camp is set in a 180,000-hectare private reserve in the heart of Botswana’s Okavango Delta, one of the world’s most important wetland ecosystems.
The Okavango Delta, one of the most iconic natural areas on the planet is a UNESCO World Heritage Site &amp; home to a great variety of wildlife, including the Abu Herd – elephants that have been rescued from exploitative situations, &amp; which will ultimately be re-introduced back into the wild.
Guests staying at Abu Camp will have the opportunity to interact with elephants in their natural habitat – a truly transformative experience.

#### Stay
Accommodation at Abu Camp consists of 6-ensuite luxurious tents, each kitted out in stylish antique furnishings &amp; fittings.  Private decks, outdoor copper baths &amp; private plunge pools with endless lagoon views are standard in all tents.
The main lounge &amp; dining areas are connected by well-lit pathways.  A well-stocked bar provides drinks &amp; cocktails around an inviting campfire setting.  The lodge also has a secluded plunge pool for guests to cool off &amp; relax.

#### Activities
The Abu Private Reserve offers both superb Okavango Delta wildlife viewing, and the opportunity to witness the elephants of the Abu Herd as they prepare - at their own pace - to be released into the wild. Time spent at Abu gives you a deeper understanding of elephant conservation - the premise on which Abu is based.
Morning &amp; afternoon game drives, night drives as well as exciting nature walks are other activities on offer.  During the seasonal floods in winter, guests can also experience mokoro trips (traditional dug-out canoes) on the waterways of the Okavango Delta.
