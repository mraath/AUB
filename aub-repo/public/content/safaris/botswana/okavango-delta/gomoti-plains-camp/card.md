# Gomoti Plains Camp
## Okavango Delta
### Gomoti Plains Camp

#### Experience
Gomoti Plains Camp is located within a community-run concession on the edge of the Gomoti River system southeast of the Okavango Delta.  
In Botswana, the locals know the Gomoti tree as the ‘water fig’ as it grows alongside the Okavango Delta’s waterways &amp; sometimes grows no bigger than a bush.  Large concentrations of wildlife thrive on the Gomoti plains &amp; waterways as the trees provide excellent cover for nesting water birds.

#### Stay
Gomoti Plains Camp has 10 luxury tents which include 8 luxury double tents &amp; 2 luxury family tents, all with en-suite facilities.  
The main area consists of a dining area, cosy library &amp; sparkling swimming pool where can guests can cool off or relax after a day out in the bush.

#### Activities
Day &amp; night drives in open 4x4 vehicles bring guests up, close &amp; personal with Botswana’s wildlife.  Nature walks are also available for those who wish to learn about animal tracks, plants &amp; smaller animals.
Dug-out canoe safaris, called ‘mokoros’ will take guests into the shallower waters of the Okavango Delta with an experienced poler.  This activity is dependent on water levels.  
Motorboat safaris are also on offer &amp; dependent on water levels.
