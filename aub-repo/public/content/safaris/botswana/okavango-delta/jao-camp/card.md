# Jao Camp
## Okavango Delta
### Jao Camp

#### Experience
Jao Camp lies on a remote island in the heart of the Okavango Delta in an area fringed with riverine forests, vast floodplains &amp; prolific wildlife.
Some would argue that this area provides some of the most stunning scenery in Botswana.
The 60,000 hectares Jao Concession borders the Moremi Game Reserve &amp; offers fantastic land &amp; water-based wildlife viewing year-round.  The area comprises a superb variety of habitats, ranging from permanent waterways &amp; lagoons to thick Kalahari soils.

#### Stay
Jao Camp has 5 luxury tents, all set beneath a canopy of shady trees.  Each tent has an en-suite bathroom with a romantic outdoor shower.
A favourite among Jao visitors is the private sala set on your viewing deck where afternoon siestas &amp; wonderful views of the floodplains can be enjoyed.  
There are also 2 villas, each one comprising 2 en-suite tents that accommodate 4 people in total.
These tented villas are ideal for families or friends travelling together as the tents are connecting by a shared lounge &amp; dining area, private butler, kitchenette with private chef, fire deck &amp; private plunge pool.  Guests staying in the villas will also have access to a private vehicle &amp; guide.
The main area consists of a lounge &amp; dining area as well as 2 large plunge pools &amp; an outdoor boma for dining under the stars.

#### Activities
A full range of land &amp; water activities includes day &amp; night drives, walking safaris, mokoro trips in dug-out canoes, boating &amp; catch &amp; release fishing.  These activities are usually on offer all year round.  
Guests can also enjoy gourmet picnics on the nearby Hunda Island, exercise in the bush gym, or sleep out under the African stars in one of their romantic Star Beds.
Spa treatments are also available.
