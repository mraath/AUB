### Gunn's Camp

#### Experience
Deep in the heart of the Okavango Delta, overlooking Chief’s Island &amp; bordering the Moremi Game Reserve, lies the exquisite Gunn’s Camp.  
This eco-friendly safari camp provides luxurious comfort in Botswana’s beautiful wilderness.  This area has an abundance of birdlife – especially in the wet summer season between December &amp; April.

#### Stay
Gunn’s Camp offers 6 deluxe Meru-style tents with en-suite facilities, featuring standalone baths &amp; outdoor private showers.  The camp is built on raised platforms overlooking the delta plains, &amp; ideal for honeymooners or guests looking for a more intimate &amp; personalized safari experience.  
The main area comprises a comfortable lounge, dining room, swimming pool &amp; bar area where guests can enjoy sundowners or pre-dinner cocktails.

#### Activities
Since Gunn’s Camp is a classic water camp, where safari activities revolve around the water channels of the Delta, guests can enjoy motorboat trips, mokoro excursions in dug-out canoes &amp; guided game walks.
Knowledgeable &amp; friendly guides will take guests on a journey through Botswana by teaching them about local fauna &amp; flora.
