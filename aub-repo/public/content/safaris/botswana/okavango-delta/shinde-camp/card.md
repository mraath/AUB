# Shinde Camp
## Okavango Delta
### Shinde Camp

#### Experience
Shinde Camp is situated on a lush palm-fringed island in the heart of the Okavango Delta in Botswana.  Set on the edge of Shinde Lagoon, a popular drinking spot for many animals, it is not surprising to find excellent wildlife viewing year-round.
Guests staying at Shinde will be delighted to experience a luxurious &amp; intimate camp surrounded by the gorgeous Okavango Deltaâ€™s waterways, floodplains &amp; swamps.

#### Stay
Shinde Camp comprises 7 classic safari tents, each with en-suite bathroom facilities, offering spectacular views over the water &amp; open grasslands.
There is also a family tent, consisting of 2 bedrooms &amp; a shared bathroom with indoor &amp; outdoor shower.
The main area has a wonderful tree-house type feel as it is set under a thick canopy of ebony, mangosteen &amp; water fig trees.  
There are 3 separate lounge levels, with other seating areas tucked away on the walkways.  The camp also boasts a dining room, bar area with a fire pit, swimming pool &amp; curio shop.

#### Activities
Shinde Camp offers a variety of land &amp; water activities.  Due to its fantastic location, open 4x4 game drives, nature walks, mokoro trips, boating &amp; fishing can all be enjoyed from camp.
Night drives are also possible at Shinde.  It is quite amazing to explore the bush after dark, accompanied by a qualified guide with nothing but the sounds of the wild, a torchlight &amp; the fresh smell of the bush in your nostrils.
