# Little Vumbura
## Okavango Delta
### Little Vumbura

#### Experience
Little Vumbura is situated on a beautiful island in the northern region of the Okavango Delta, in the same area as its sister camp, Vumbura Plains.

The camp is completely surrounded by water, ensuring spectacular views over the floodplains &amp;  excellent water activities throughout the year.  Due to its remote location, game viewing is superb all year round, with frequent sightings of lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo &amp; extensive plains game.

#### Stay
Little Vumbura is a relaxed, yet beautiful 6-roomed tented camp shaded by the canopy of an ancient Okavango Delta forest.  Five of these tents are double tents &amp; 1 of them is a family unit consisting of 2 inter-leading bedrooms.
Each tent is beautifully decorated &amp; has en-suite facilities.  An all-time favourite among guests is the plunge pool &amp; reading area overlooking the water as well as the star deck leading off the dining area.
Because the camp is so small, guests will experience absolute privacy &amp; seclusion in a pristine Okavango Delta setting.  Little Vumbura is the type of camp where you can put your feet up &amp; relax completely.

#### Activities
What makes Little Vumbura so special, is the fact that year-round land &amp; water activities are on offer.  A focus is placed on water-based activities such as mokoro trips in dug-out canoes as well as motorboat safaris along the waterways of the Okavango Delta.  
Open 4x4 game drives in Land Rovers allow guests to get close to animals in savannah areas.  Bush walks are available on request.
