# Selinda Camp
## Selinda Game Reserve
### Selinda Camp

#### Experience
Selinda Camp overlooks the Selinda Spillway, a unique seasonal waterway that links the Okavango Delta with the Linyanti Swamps.
Packed with some of Africa’s wildest animals, the region enjoys an abundance of game, including predators, antelope &amp; over 300 bird species.

#### Stay
Selinda Camp has 3 luxurious tents, set under cool thatch canopies, each with panoramic views across the beautiful floodplains.  Each tent has an en-suite bathroom, kitted out with a stone bath as the central piece.  The bathroom has lots of natural light as it is uniquely “open air,” so guests can get closer to Botswana’s natural surroundings.  
In addition to the 3 tents, there is also The 2-bedroom Selinda Suite that operates exclusively, as guests enjoy a private vehicle, safari guide, chef, manager/butler &amp; entrance to their residence.
The main area comprises a series of large decks overlooking the Selinda Spillway as well as a lounge &amp; open-air star deck.  Separate from the main area is an art gallery built above a wine cellar &amp; curio shop.

#### Activities
Activities at Selinda Camp include morning, afternoon &amp; night drives with experienced guides as well as short walks around camp for those wishing to get to know some of the smaller creatures of Africa.  
The Young Explorers Programme will keep the little ones entertained &amp; enable them to learn &amp; have fun.  
Each of Selinda’s tents comes with a pair of high-quality binoculars for guest use as well as a professional Canon camera set, including a Canon 5D camera body &amp; Canon 100-400mm &amp; 24-70mm lenses.  
Photos will be downloaded to a memory stick on guests’ departure.  Photographic tuition is also available at an extra cost.
