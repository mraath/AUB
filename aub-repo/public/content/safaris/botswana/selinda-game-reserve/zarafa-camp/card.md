## Selinda Game Reserve
### Zarafa Camp

#### Experience
Zarafa Camp overlooks the magnificent Zibadianja Lagoon – the source of the world-famous Savute Channel.
The Selinda Reserve is famous for its massive herds of elephants &amp; large populations of predators, such as lion, leopard, cheetah &amp; wild dog.   Abundant plains game can also be found here, including kudu, buffalo, zebra &amp; giraffe.

#### Stay
Zarafa Camp consists of only 4 luxuriously appointed safari tents.  Hosting a maximum of 8 guests, the emphasis at Zarafa Camp is on offering guests a private or exclusive safari experience.  
Each tent has a private veranda, positioned under shady trees with breathtaking views of the Zibadianja Lagoon.  The bedrooms are large &amp; have en-suite bathrooms, featuring a copper bath as well as indoor &amp; outdoor showers.

Zarafa Camp is furnished in 20th-century décor &amp; finishes.  The main area consists of a lounge &amp; dining area – both set under canvas as well as a large viewing deck shaded by giant trees.

#### Activities
Activities at Zarafa include morning, afternoon &amp; night drives in open 4x4 safari vehicles as well as guided bush walks.  Guests will be accompanied by professional guides who will introduce them to some of Africa’s most interesting wildlife.  
Another way to relax &amp; experience all Africa has to offer, is by enjoying a traditional African massage in the privacy of your tent.
