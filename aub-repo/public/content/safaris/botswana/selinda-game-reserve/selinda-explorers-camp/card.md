# Selinda Explorers Camp
## Selinda Game Reserve
### Selinda Explorers Camp

#### Experience
Selinda Explorers Camp overlooks the Selinda Spillway, a unique seasonal waterway that links the Okavango Delta with the Linyanti Swamps.  Its sister camp, Selinda, is located about one hour west.
Packed with some of Africa’s wildest animals, the region enjoys an abundance of game, including predators, antelope &amp; over 300 bird species.
This is an unassuming camp, light on its footprint but heavy on its experiential luxury.

#### Stay
Selinda Explorers Camp has 4 custom-designed tents, transporting us back to authentic safaris, with a modern twist on hospitality.  
There are only 2 custom-designed semi-permanent tents, consisting of 2 rooms each.  Each tent has a veranda as well as a private open-air “bustani” bathroom with hot water bucket showers &amp; a flush toilet.
The main area comprises a bar, restaurant &amp; Kids Club area where the young ones will be entertained during the day.

#### Activities
Activities at Selinda Explorers Camp include morning, afternoon &amp; night drives with experienced guides as well as short walks around camp for those wishing to get to know some of the smaller creatures of Africa.  
The Young Explorers Programme will keep the little ones entertained &amp; enable them to learn &amp; have fun.
