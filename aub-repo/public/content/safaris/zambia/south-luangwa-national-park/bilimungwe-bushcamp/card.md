# Bilimungwe Bushcamp
## South Luangwa National Park
### Bilimungwe Bushcamp

#### Experience
Bilimungwe Bushcamp enjoys an ideal location in the wild &amp; unspoilt region of Zambia’s South Luangwa National Park.
This intimate &amp; remote safari camp boasts an ideal setting on the shaded banks of the Luangwa River, with views over the wildlife-packed grassy floodplains – a nature lover’s paradise!
Travellers looking for an off-the-beaten-track safari experience will love Bilimungwe with its beautiful reed &amp; thatch chalets – the perfect blend between rustic &amp; luxury.
The camp is seasonal &amp; is only open from May to December.

#### Stay
There are only 4 raised chalets at Bilimungwe – each carefully designed to maximize the views of 1 or 2 of the 3 waterholes in front of camp.
Each elegant chalet features an en-suite bathroom with an open-air waterfall shower &amp; a private viewing deck.
The main lodge area comprises a lounge, bar &amp; dining room built on stilts around a large, old termite mound under an ancient mahogany tree which provides ample shade from the hot sunshine.  
Bilimungwe’s secret breakfast spot – on the edge of Luangwa Valley – is the ideal place to watch the sunrise over the Chindeni Hills.

#### Activities
A variety of safari activities are available at Bilimungwe Bushcamp.  
These include open 4x4 game drives with professional guides &amp; trackers as well as guided morning &amp; afternoon walking safaris where guests can explore the bush on foot – while watching the sunset. 
In between activities, time can be spent in one of the lazy hammocks set in a beautiful spot overlooking the Luangwa River.
