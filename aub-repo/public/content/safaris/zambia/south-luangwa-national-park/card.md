### South Luangwa National Park

#### Experience
South Luangwa National Park is, without a doubt, Zambia’s premier wildlife destination.
Wild, remote & packed with game, the region is known for offering the best walking safaris in Africa. The 9,000 sq km reserve is still largely unexplored, but at its focal point, you will find the meandering Luangwa River – a huge drawcard for thirsty animals.
Luxurious camps & lodges are scattered along the Luangwa River, boasting spectacular views over the water’s edge where large herds of elephants & buffaloes as well as lion, hippo & crocodile gather to quench their thirst.
South Luangwa also has a high density of leopard as well as endemic species such Crawshay’s zebra & Thornicroft’s giraffe, plus all the plains game such as zebra, Thomson’s gazelle & antelope.

#### Activities
This park was the birthplace of guided walking safaris & still takes the prize as the best place in Africa to experience the thrill of walking through big game country.
Expert guides, many of whom grew up in the area, will take you on a journey through Africa’s most remote & unexplored regions - on foot as well as on open 4x4 game drives.
Adventurous travellers can choose to overnight at a remote tented camp where the focus is on walking safaris, after which they can end their safari at one of the luxurious lodges on the banks of the Luangwa River – the ideal place to relax in style.

#### When to travel
The best time to travel to South Luangwa National Park is during the dry season, which is from May to October - with wildlife season peaking from July. Water in the bush has dried up, so animals congregate around the Luangwa River & other water sources.
Note that October & November are extremely hot, & some people may find conditions difficult to cope with during these months.
Much of South Luangwa National Park gets flooded during the wet summer season (from November to April), so many camps close during this time & reopen after the rains have ended in April.
