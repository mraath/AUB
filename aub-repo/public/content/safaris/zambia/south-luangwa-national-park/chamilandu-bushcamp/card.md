### Chamilandu Bushcamp

#### Experience
Chamilandu Bushcamp enjoys an ideal location in the wild &amp; unspoilt region of Zambia’s South Luangwa National Park.
This intimate &amp; remote safari camp boasts an ideal setting on the shaded banks of the Luangwa River, with views over the wildlife-packed grassy floodplains – a nature lover’s paradise!
Travellers looking for an off-the-beaten-track safari experience will love Chamilandu with its beautiful tree-house chalets – the perfect blend between rustic &amp; luxury.

#### Stay
There are only 3 raised chalets at Chamilandu – each carefully designed to maximize the views of the river.  The front of each treehouse opens out on a 180 degrees view of the Luangwa River &amp; Nchindeni Hills.
Each of the 2-metre high chalets offers an en-suite bathroom that opens to the stars.
The main lodge area comprises a lounge, bar &amp; dining room as well as a raised observation hide offering spectacular views over the river &amp; surrounds.

#### Activities
A variety of safari activities are available at Chamilandu Bushcamp.  
These include open 4x4 game drives with professional guides &amp; trackers as well as guided morning &amp; afternoon walking safaris where guests can explore the bush on foot – while watching the sunset. 
Bird watching is also popular in South Luangwa.
