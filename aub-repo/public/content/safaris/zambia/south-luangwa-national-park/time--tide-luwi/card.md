## South Luangwa National Park
### Time + Tide Luwi

#### Experience
With a prime location in the heart of South Luangwa National Park, Time + Tide Luwi is an authentic safari camp that offers exceptional wildlife encounters &amp; fun-filled safari activities.
Luwi Camp is named after the seasonal river that flows nearby between January &amp; April.
There are no other camps for miles around &amp; it is here where you will find one of the densest concentrations of game in Africa - including elephant, hippo, lion, leopard, wild dog, giraffe, wildebeest &amp; 400 species of birds.
The wildlife hide nearby overlooks a lively oxbow lagoon, which is ideal for photography.

#### Stay
Time + Tide Luwi has 5 comfortable hut-type rooms overlooking a floodplain where hippos &amp; elephants are frequently spotted.  
Each hut boasts an open-air en-suite bathroom with an outdoor private seating area where days are often spent with a book while watching the passing wildlife.
The communal area features a main lounge with comfortable sofas, a bar where pre-dinner gin &amp; tonics are often served &amp; a hammock overlooking the floodplains.

#### Activities
Activities at Luwi include day &amp; night drives in open 4x4 vehicles in search of Africaâ€™s fiercest predators as well as guided walking safaris where a qualified tracker will share his expert knowledge of the bush. 
Guests can also sleep out under the stars if they are feeling adventurous.
