Set in a private concession on the banks of a river, Time + Tide Chinzombo – Zambia’s most luxurious safari camp - offers direct access to the world-renowned South Luangwa National Park.

Each suite also includes a private deck with a plunge pool where guests can cool off in the heat of the day.  
The main lodge area comprises a shady deck with a swimming pool, a wellness spa &amp; a pilates area.

#### Activities
Time + Tide Chinzombo offers a range of exciting activities, including day &amp; night drives along with guided nature walks &amp; cultural visits to the local village.
