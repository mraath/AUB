# Island Bush Camp
## South Luangwa National Park
### Island Bush Camp

#### Experience
Island Bush Camp boasts a spectacular location in a very remote, yet extremely game-rich area in the southern section of Zambiaâ€™s South Luangwa National Park.
Far away from crowds in a pristine wilderness environment, this seasonal camp is only open during the best wildlife months between May &amp; November.
With breathtaking views over the Luangwa River, Island Bush Camp offers authentic walking safaris with expert guides.

#### Stay
The camp accommodations only 10 guests in 5 open-sided chalets built on stilts, each offering panoramic views of the Luangwa River. 
Each bedroom extends to a viewing deck where lazy afternoons can be spent watching wildlife in action.  Each en-suite bathroom is equipped with a bucket shower &amp; flushing toilet.
The camp is completely solar-powered.  In the main area, you will find a communal lounge, dining room &amp; bar.

#### Activities
Island Bush Camp focuses on walking safaris with expert guides, but open 4x4 game drives are also offered.  
There is also a photographic hide just outside the camp, which is the perfect place to observe &amp; photograph elephants as they come to drink &amp; wallow in the small pond.
