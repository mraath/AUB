## South Luangwa National Park
### Nkwali Camp

#### Experience
Nkwali Camp lies in a game-rich area of ebony woodland just outside the world-renowned South Luangwa National Park.
This area offers some of the best game viewing in Zambia – including regular sightings of leopard, hippo &amp; giraffe - &amp; it is not uncommon to see elephants cross the river.
Guests travelling to South Luangwa will be able to explore this pristine bush environment on foot while being accompanied by an expert guide.
Expert guides with specialized birding skills combined with a bird list of 400 species make Nkwali a wonderful choice for birdwatchers.

#### Stay
Nkwali Camp offers 6 spacious en-suite chalets that can fully open to beautiful river views.  During the evenings, doors are being closed to allow a peaceful night’s rest.
Each en-suite bathroom is generous in size &amp; features double sinks &amp; showers allowing beautiful views of the African skies.
The main lodge comprises a dining room, small library, bar &amp; swimming pool.

#### Activities
The park can be explored on foot with an accompanying guide or via open 4x4 game drives which take place during the morning &amp; afternoon.  
Exciting night drives are also available for those looking to search for nocturnal animals with a spotlight.  Boating safaris on the river are available in season.
Kids can either join their parents on game drives or stay at camp under the close supervision of trained staff.  They can do fun quizzes or puzzles &amp; even go on outings to the Kawaza school to meet Zambian children.
