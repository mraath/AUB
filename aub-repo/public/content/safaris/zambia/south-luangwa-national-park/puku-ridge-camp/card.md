## South Luangwa National Park
### Puku Ridge Camp

#### Experience
The luxurious Puku Ridge Camp boasts a spectacular location in the untamed wilderness of Zambia’s South Luangwa National Park.
This African-chic camp offers uninterrupted views of the seemingly endless savannah - where lions, leopard, elephants, giraffes, hyenas &amp; buffalos roam – many of which are frequently spotted from the comfort of the viewing deck.
The photographic hide with its unique views of the waterhole attracts predators &amp; prey alike &amp; is the ideal place for photography enthusiasts to kick off their shoes &amp; capture special wildlife moments.

#### Stay
There are 8 luxurious suites at Puku Ridge, each overlooking the magnificent Puku Ridge floodplain &amp; its seemingly endless parade of wildlife.
Each air-conditioned suite features a lounge area, an en-suite bathroom with indoor &amp; outdoor shower, a deck with a private plunge pool &amp; a star/day bed tower where romantic evenings can be spent sleeping under the African skies.
The main area at Puku Ridge features a communal lounge &amp; dining area with a bar, open-air deck &amp; campfire overlooking the wildlife-frequented waterhole.

#### Activities
Zambia is known for its excellent walking safaris that will get you up close to fauna &amp; flora.  
Guests can also explore the bush at night in open 4x4 safari vehicles.  The award-winning red light protocol is used at Puku Ridge, allowing guests to observe how predators hunt without their knowledge.
