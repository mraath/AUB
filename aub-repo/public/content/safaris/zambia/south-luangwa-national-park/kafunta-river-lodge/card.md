#### Experience
The classic Kafunta River Lodge boasts a spectacular location at the edge of a floodplain overlooking the Luangwa River in Zambia’s premier wildlife park:  South Luangwa.

Kafunta’s accommodation consists of 8 luxury chalets &amp; 2 luxury suites with a mezzanine, sleeping up to 4 people.  Each en-suite chalet has been built on stilts &amp; offers a private veranda with magnificent views of the river.  
The luxury suites are set further away from the main dining area &amp; sleep up to 4 people.  Each en-suite bathroom includes a shower &amp; stand-alone bath.  There are 2 viewing decks at each suite, one upstairs &amp; one downstairs – both overlooking the floodplains.
The lodge area features a lounge, dining room, bar, spa, gym &amp; infinity pool.  A bonus is their natural hot tub next to the pool – the only one in the Luangwa Valley.  With an average temperature of 37 degrees Celsius, guests can even use it during the cooler months from May to July.
