# Nsefu Camp
## South Luangwa National Park
### Nsefu Camp

#### Experience
Nsefu, the first Zambian photographic safari camp in the area is perched on a scenic bend on the Luangwa River in the remote Nsefu area of South Luangwa National Park.
The camp is ideal for those looking to experience sensational game viewing as well as exceptional bird watching since its location offers the perfect blend between both.
In fact, the main lounge &amp; bar area offers spectacular views over the bush, so guests can enjoy armchair game viewing without ever leaving camp!
Between mid-January &amp; late March, the Luangwa River floods – but this allows for boat access into areas that are inaccessible during other times of the year, providing a unique safari experience.
Another “must-do” at Nsefu, is their overnight walking safari that ends at a fly camp – a simple bush camp that sleeps 4 people.

#### Stay
Nsefu has 6 brick &amp; thatch huts with en-suite facilities that have been designed to offer the perfect blend between traditional &amp; luxury.  
Each hut is completely open in the front - offering unbeatable views over the river &amp; South Luangwa.

#### Activities
Activities at Nsefu Camp include day &amp; night drives in 4x4 vehicles, guided walking safaris, seasonal boating &amp; overnight walking safaris.
