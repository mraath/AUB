# Lion Camp
## South Luangwa National Park
### Lion Camp

#### Experience
Lion Camp is a privately owned safari lodge with a prime location on the edge of an oxbow lagoon in the South Luangwa National Park.
The lagoon attracts a wide variety of wildlife, including lion, leopard, wild dog, large herds of elephants &amp; buffaloes as well as the highest concentration of hippos in Africa!  
With a remote setting in a quiet corner of the park, Lion Camp offers a truly exclusive safari experience with only a handful of safari vehicles.

#### Stay
There are 10 luxurious timber, canvas &amp; thatch suites – designed to maximize the spectacular views.  
Each suite has a private deck overlooking the plains where plenty of wildlife pass through every day.  The suites are connected to the main area by wooden walkways.
At the main lodge, you will find a spacious &amp; open-plan thatched area with private nooks, seating areas &amp; a swimming pool.  There is also a small library &amp; bar where delicious cocktails are served.

#### Activities
Walking safaris are the focus at Lion Camp, although open 4x4 game drives are also offered for guests interested to go further afield or look for nocturnal animals with a spotlight.
Dinners can be enjoyed al fresco – under the stars.
