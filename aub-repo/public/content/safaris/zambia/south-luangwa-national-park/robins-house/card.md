#### Experience
The exclusive Robin’s House enjoys a lovely setting on the banks of the Luangwa River in Zambia’s South Luangwa National Park.
With breathtaking views of the river, this private Zambia villa - previously the home of the owner, Robin Pope - is the ideal safari choice for families who want to reconnect at their own pace.
A private guide, safari vehicle &amp; chef will be at your disposal when staying at Robin’s House, so guests can enjoy a flexible schedule when it comes to activities &amp; mealtimes.

Guests’ requirements will be looked after by a personal ranger, chef, housekeeper &amp; valet during their time on a private safari.

#### Activities
Flexibility is what Robin’s House is all about.  There is no set schedule, so guests can tailor their safari experience to their needs.
