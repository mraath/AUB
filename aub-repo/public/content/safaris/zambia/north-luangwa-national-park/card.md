### North Luangwa National Park

#### Experience
Africa has a few well-kept secrets, &amp Zambia’s North Luangwa National Park is one of them.
One of Africa’s wildest safari destinations, the park offers an off-the-beaten-track wildlife experience to safari-goers who are looking for ‘the real Africa.’
There are no permanent camps found in North Luangwa - only a handful of intimate, seasonal camps, a few roads &amp a trickle of visitors, making this region one of the most untouched wildlife destinations in Africa.
The number of visitors should not fool you! Exceptional animal encounters can be expected in this wild slice of Africa. The reserve is home to large numbers of lion prides, huge herds of elephants &amp buffaloes, as well as leopard, hyena &amp a variety of other animals.

#### Activities
North Luangwa is renowned for its world-class walking safaris &amp this is one of the main reasons why travellers choose this part of Zambia for their safari holiday. Expert guides – some of the best on the continent – will share their passion &amp knowledge of the bush as you explore the deepest, most remote corners of Africa on foot.
Some camps also offer open 4x4 game drives – a thrilling experience that will take you closer to some of Africa’s more dangerous predators.

#### When to travel
The best time to travel to North Luangwa National Park is during the dry season, which is from June to October. During this time, the grass is low &amp animals are easy to find.
Note that much of North Luangwa National Park gets flooded during the wet summer season (from November to April), so all camps are closed during this time &amp reopen after the rains have ended in April.
During May, it rains less, but there is still a lot of water around, so it is best to visit from June to October.
