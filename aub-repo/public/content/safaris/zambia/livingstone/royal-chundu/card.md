### Royal Chundu

#### Experience
Zambia’s family-owned &amp; run Royal Chundu is set on a private stretch of riverbank on the Zambezi River, just upstream of the iconic Victoria Falls.
Royal Chundu consists of 2 lodges – River Lodge &amp; Island Lodge, &amp; as the name suggests, both properties are fit for royalty.  Ideal for honeymooners, couples or families, Royal Chundu is all about exceeding expectations.
The lodge is only a 40-minute drive from the Falls, making it the ideal base to explore this world wonder.

#### Stay
River Lodge at Royal Chundu is the main hub &amp; the larger of the 2 lodges.  There are 10 beautifully appointed, spacious riverfront suites, each with an en-suite bathroom, air-conditioning &amp; a generous deck with spectacular views.
The entire lodge looks out onto the mighty Zambezi River on the opposite side of the river.
Island Lodge at Royal Chundu is the more private &amp; exclusive of the 2 lodges.  With a stunning location on Katambura Private Island, the lodge is surrounded by gentle river channels &amp; lush trees.  There are 4 elegant, air-conditioned villas at Island Lodge, each comprising an en-suite bathroom with a large open-air bath &amp; a spectacular deck with views.

#### Activities
Apart from visiting the thundering Victoria Falls, guests may choose to take a short mokoro (dug-out canoe) trip to a local village or visit one of the local villages.  Game drives &amp; birding are also popular activities.
In addition to the above, guests can also do a trip to Livingstone town &amp; enjoy a microlight flight over the Falls, river rafting or sunset boat cruises on the Zambezi.
A highlight is having lunch at Livingstone Island &amp; swimming at Devil’s Pool – the edge of the mighty Vic Falls.
