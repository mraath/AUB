#### Experience
Amboseli Sopa Lodge, a rustic-luxury safari lodge boasts an ideal location close to Kenya’s Amboseli National Park – home to the Maasai tribal people.
With spectacular views over the snow-capped peaks of Kilimanjaro, it is the ideal base to enjoy a Kenyan safari as well as attempt to conquer the mountain. (Or at least – climb it in spirit!)
The Amboseli National Park allows guests to enjoy exciting safari activities like game drives &amp; guided walks, meet the interesting Maasai people &amp; get close to free-roaming elephants – one of the few places in Africa where this is still possible.

#### Stay
Accommodation consists of 83 varying categories of rooms, each with an en-suite bathroom &amp; private veranda.  
Two of these rooms are wheelchair-friendly &amp; some of these rooms are interconnecting, making them ideal for families.
The main lodge features 2 restaurants, 3 themed bars &amp; a sparkling swimming pool with iconic views across the foothills of Kilimanjaro.
