All villas have private living areas &amp; en-suite bathrooms complete with indoor &amp; outdoor showers with glorious views.
Each villa boasts 360-degree views over the dramatic northern Kenyan landscape, &amp; on a cloud-free day, you can see the snow-covered peak of Mount Kenya from your room.
The main lodge features a dining area, bar, Kids Club, spa &amp; 2 swimming pools.
