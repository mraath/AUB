# Little Governors' Camp
## Masai Mara
### Little Governors' Camp

#### Experience
Utterly secluded &amp; reachable only by boat across the Mara River, Little Governors’ Camp boasts a spectacular location on the edge of the Masai Mara National Reserve in Kenya.
After a boat ride &amp; a short, escorted walk through a riverine forest, this eco-friendly safari camp is utterly quiet &amp; undisturbed.  
The camp &amp; tents are tucked around a large waterhole that teems with wildlife &amp; birds, so Little Governors’ Camp provides action during &amp; after game drives.  
Because the camp is unfenced, resident elephants &amp; warthogs are often spotted from the deck.

#### Stay
Accommodation at Little Governors’ comprises 17 luxury en-suite tents, all overlooking an active waterhole that teems with both wildlife &amp; birds.
Each tent has a wooden deck with a large veranda to enjoy the constant game activity that takes place around the waterhole.  
The main lodge includes a lounge &amp; dining area as well as a bar, Kids Club &amp; spa.

#### Activities
Camp activities at Little Governors’ includes open 4x4 game drives with professional rangers, walking safaris, hot air balloon rides over the game-packed plains, excursions to Maasai villages, photographic safaris &amp; visits to the Mara-Meru Cheetah Project.
