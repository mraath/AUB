### Kicheche Mara Camp

#### Experience
Kicheche Mara Camp boasts a spectacular location in the Mara North Conservancy in Kenya’s world-renowned Masai Mara – a World Heritage Site that is known for its annual Wildebeest Migration.
Not only can guests witness the Great Migration in season, but expect phenomenal year-round wildlife viewing.  
Because this luxury tented camp is unfenced, animals easily move in &amp; out of camp, ensuring an authentic &amp; wild safari experience.
With a friendly ‘home away from home’ atmosphere, guests arrive as visitors &amp; leave as friends.

#### Stay
Kicheche Mara Camp is small &amp; intimate, consisting of only 9 luxury safari tents – including 1 family unit.  Triple- &amp; quadruple-bed tents are available for families with children.
The tents are widely spaced apart alongside a seasonal stream to ensure complete privacy &amp; come with en-suite bathrooms &amp; private verandas with deck chairs from where guests can enjoy beautiful views &amp; armchair game viewing.
The family suite comprises 2 bedrooms, each with an en-suite bathroom.  The bedrooms are connected by a lounge furnished with a sofa &amp; table for private dining.
The main area includes a spacious lounge tent with a small library &amp; dining area where delicious meals are served.

#### Activities
Guests staying at Kicheche Mara can enjoy exhilarating game drives &amp; nature walks led by experienced guides (all of whom have at least a silver-level rating from the Kenya Professional Safari Guides Association) as well as visit a local Maasai village to learn more about their culture.
