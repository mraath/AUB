### Ol Seki Hemingways Mara

#### Experience
Within the heart of the Naboisho Conservancy, bordering the Masai Mara Reserve, lies Ol Seki Hemingways, a beautiful private tented camp with breathtaking views.
The conservancy limits the number of safari vehicles, so guests staying at Ol Seki can have an authentic &amp; intimate safari experience.
Ol Seki – named after the sandpiper tree – is perched on a ridge overlooking the plains, so it is fitting that the innovative architecture echoes the panoramic views.

#### Stay
There are 10 unusual high-dome tents at Ol Seki, each with an en-suite bathroom.  
Six of the standard tents are called ‘Nina’ – after the architect’s daughter &amp; the other 2-bedroom suite tents are called ‘Chui’ &amp; ‘Simba.’
Simba consists of 2 inter-connected tents sharing a central lounge, making this an ideal option for families.  Chui has a similar arrangement, however, each of the tents is separate rather than being interconnected.
Guests staying in the suites will have a private butler who will be serving them drinks or cooking meals in the suite’s kitchen.
The communal areas at Ol Seki Hemingways include a cosy lounge, dining area, bar, library &amp; swimming pool.

#### Activities
A range of exhilarating safari activities is available at Ol Seki.
These include open 4x4 game drives (including full-day safaris into the Masai Mara during the annual Migration), guided walks with an experienced Maasai guide, community visits, horseback riding &amp; hot air balloon safaris over the vast Kenyan plains.
