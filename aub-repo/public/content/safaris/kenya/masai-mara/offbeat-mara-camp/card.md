## Masai Mara
### Offbeat Mara Camp

#### Experience
Offbeat Mara is a small, traditional safari camp, situated within the 74,000-acre Mara North Conservancy in Kenya.
The conservancy is only open to member camps, thus limiting the number of safari vehicles &amp; keeping the footprint light.
Is no surprise that Offbeat Mara offers some of the best wildlife viewing in the Masai Mara.  Their resident lions – The Offbeat Pride – are frequently seen within a short distance from camp &amp; can regularly be heard roaring in the Offbeat Valley.
The camp offers fantastic year-round game viewing – especially big cat sightings as well as expert guiding &amp; exceptional service.

#### Stay
Offbeat Mara offers 5 traditional safari tents as well as 2 family tents, each equipped with an en-suite bathroom &amp; a large veranda with bush views.  
All the tents have flush loos, safari showers &amp; jugs of water for the basins.  Each of the family tents has 2 sleeping areas, one with a large double bed &amp; the other with 2 or 3 single beds.
The main area includes a lounge, dining space, bar &amp; library.

#### Activities
Because of the camp’s superb location in a private conservancy, a wide range of safari activities are available.  These include game drives, night drives, walking safaris, bush meals, sundowners, cultural village visits, hot air balloon safaris, visits to the Koiyaki Guiding School &amp; fishing.
A team of Maasai guides are more than happy to entertain the little ones while Mum &amp; Dad are taking an afternoon siesta.  They will teach the kids to fire a Masai bow &amp; arrow, bead with some of the ladies from the community, fish or even bake a cake for afternoon tea.
