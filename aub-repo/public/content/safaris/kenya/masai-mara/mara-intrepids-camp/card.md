## Masai Mara
### Mara Intrepids Camp

#### Experience
Shaded by large trees &amp; spread out along the Talek River, Mara Intrepids Camp sits at the confluence of the Masai Mara’s 4 game viewing areas.  
Only a short drive away is the Mara River, where one can witness the iconic Wildebeest Migration river crossing which takes place between July &amp; August each year.
The camp is fenced, which makes it an ideal choice for families who wish to let their children roam freely between safari activities.  The fun-filled Adventurers’ Club will keep the young ones entertained by teaching them about survival skills &amp; conservation.

#### Stay
Mara Intrepids Camp consists of 30 luxury tents that are widely spread across the riverfront to ensure guests the optimum privacy &amp; space.  One of these tents is a 2-bedroom family unit.
Each spacious en-suite tent is built on a raised wooden platform to maximize the sweeping views over the riverbanks where a large variety of animals come to drink.
The 2-bedroom family tent can sleep 2 adults &amp; 2 children below 12 years of age.
Mara Intrepid’s main area includes a cosy lounge, a well-stocked bar &amp; a large wooden deck with a refreshing swimming pool.

#### Activities
A range of exciting activities includes open 4x4 game drives with expert rangers, cultural visits to local Maasai communities, guided walking safaris &amp; bird watching.
