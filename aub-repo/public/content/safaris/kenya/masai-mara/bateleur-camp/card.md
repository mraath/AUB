### Bateleur Camp

#### Experience
With a spectacular forest setting on the edge of the Masai Mara’s endless plains, lies Bateleur Camp.
In fact, its superb location is so beautiful – it was used for the iconic closing scenes of the film ‘Out of Africa.’
Guests staying at Bateleur Camp can expect excellent year-round game viewing &amp; amazing opportunities to observe the Great Migration between August &amp; November.

#### Stay
The epitome of tented luxury, Bateleur Camp comprises 2 intimate camps of 9 tented suites each, set among the forest on the edge of the Masai Mara.
Each tent comes with a private butler &amp; features an en-suite bathroom with a stone shower, a private deck that looks out over the endless African plains.
One of these tents is a 2-bedroom family unit that consists of 2 adjoining tents, ideal for families travelling with young children.
The main area features a lounge, dining deck, pool &amp; spa.

#### Activities
Daily activities at Bateleur Camp include early morning &amp; afternoon game drives, guided bush walks &amp; spot-lit night drives in search of the Mara’s rich nocturnal species.  
Early morning hot air balloon safaris over the plains are highly recommended.
