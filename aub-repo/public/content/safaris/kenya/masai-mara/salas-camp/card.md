## Masai Mara
### Sala's Camp

#### Experience
In a shady forest overlooking the Sand River in Kenya’s Masai Mara’s northern corridor, lies Sala Camp – a luxury tented camp famed for being one of the first camps to witness the iconic Wildebeest Migration as it passes from the Serengeti into the Mara. (July – September)
This idyllic setting allows guests to watch the herds passing their tent as they gather to drink at a point where the Sand &amp; Keekorok Rivers meet.
Sala’s Camp is the perfect blend between tradition &amp; luxury.  There are private pools at each tent – a drawcard for both couples &amp; families in need of post-safari fun &amp; relaxation.

#### Stay
Sala’s Camp comprises 5 forest tents &amp; 2 river tents, each combining modern comforts with an authentic safari style.  Two of these tents are 2-bedroom family units – one overlooking the forest &amp; one overlooking the river. 
Each tent boasts an en-suite bathroom &amp; expansive veranda with a private pool offering glorious views over the Mara.
The main area at Sala’s includes a stylish lounge &amp; dining tent with a large viewing deck overlooking the Sand River as well as a small gym &amp; firepit where guests gather over a pre-dinner drink.

#### Activities
There are plenty of safari activities available to guests of all ages.  
Guests who travel between July &amp; October will have front row seats to catch the iconic river crossing of millions of wildebeest, zebra &amp; other antelope as they move in a circular migratory route in the greater Serengeti-Mara ecosystem.
Other activities include open 4x4 game drives, hot air balloon safaris, bush volleyball, gym-in-a-bag exercise equipment delivered to your tent, painting, sundowner excursions &amp; in-room spa treatments.
