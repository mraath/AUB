### Ilala Lodge

#### Experience
Ilala Lodge is ideally situated on the Zimbabwean side of the mighty Zambezi River, only a short walk from the magnificent Victoria Falls.
The perfect base from which to explore one of the World’s Seven Natural Wonders, Ilala Lodge is the closest resort to the majestic Vic Falls.  
Restaurant guests can see &amp; hear the roar of “the smoke that thunders” in the background while enjoying some of Zimbabwe’s finest cuisine.

#### Stay
Accommodation at Ilala Lodge comprises 34 standard rooms, 20 deluxe rooms, 2 standard suites, 3 executive suites &amp; 1 penthouse suite.
In the standard rooms, double French doors open out to a communal garden where wild animals are often spotted.  The deluxe rooms are slightly larger than the standard rooms, with more refined interiors.
The standard suites both have balconies where guests can relax on the comfortable chairs &amp; table provided.  The executive suites have 2 bedrooms, a lounge &amp; a private patio with beautiful sunrise views.
The penthouse suite comes complete with a private lounge, kitchen, walk-in shower, private balcony with a large spa bath while enjoying world-class views of the spray rising above the mighty Victoria Falls waterfall.  This suite can also be turned into a family villa by also booking the next-door deluxe room with an inter-leading door.
The main area features a poolside bar, restaurant &amp; spa.

#### Activities
Zimbabwe is not called the adventure capital of Africa for nothing!  There is a wide range of activities available to travellers that can either be pre-booked through us or directly at the lodge.
Some of these include helicopter flights over the Falls, white water river rafting or canoeing on the mighty Zambezi River, swimming at Devil’s Pool, lunch at Livingstone island, sunset boat cruises, bungee jumping, elephant interactions &amp; much more!
