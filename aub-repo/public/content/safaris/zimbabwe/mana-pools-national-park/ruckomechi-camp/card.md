## Mana Pools National Park
### Ruckomechi Camp

#### Experience
Ruckomechi Camp is located on the banks of the hippo-filled Zambezi River &amp; one of only a handful of lodges scattered around Zimbabwe’s Mana Pools National Park.  
The camp offers a true wilderness experience combined with ‘just the right amount’ of luxury.  Adventure seekers who are looking for an off-the-beaten-track safari experience will adore Ruckomechi Camp.
Mana Pools, a World Heritage Site, is best reached by small plane - &amp; en-route to camp guests can enjoy a bird’s eye view over this under-explored wildlife-rich landscape.
The life-giving Zambezi River is set close to the lodge, offering guests an ‘armchair’ wildlife experience without ever having to leave the lodge.

#### Stay
There are 8 luxury tents &amp; 2 stylish family suites at Ruckomechi Camp, each built on low wooden decks offering a veranda with panoramic views of the Zambezi River.
Each tent comprises an en-suite bathroom with a shower, a lounge area &amp; a veranda with deck chairs.
The 2 generous family suites offer the same amenities as the luxury tents, with the addition of having 2 en-suite bedrooms.
The main lodge area includes a lounge, dining room, bar &amp; rim-flow pool with excellent views of the river &amp; the animals that frequent it.  There are also numerous hammocks &amp; day beds where guests can put up their feet &amp; relax.

#### Activities
Safari activities at Ruckomechi Camp include land &amp; water-based options, including open 4x4 game drives, guided bush walks, boating, canoeing &amp; fishing.  
Excellent year-round game viewing can be enjoyed at Mana Pools &amp; birding is best during the summer season.
