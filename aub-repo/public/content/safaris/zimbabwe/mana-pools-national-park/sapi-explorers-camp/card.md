# Sapi Explorers Camp
## Mana Pools National Park
### Sapi Explorers Camp

#### Experience
Sapi Explorers Camp is nestled within a privately-run wildlife reserve – the 120 000 hectares Sapi Concession, next to Zimbabwe’s legendary Mana Pools National Park.
The camp lies quite literally a stone’s throw from the Zambezi River, where plenty of animal activity takes place.
Frequent sightings of big cats, wild dogs, elephants, hippos &amp; buffalo are seen here &amp; the area is abundant in birdlife.  This wild &amp; remote part of Zimbabwe is ideal for seasoned safari travellers looking for a unique &amp; off-the-beaten-track safari experience.
The small &amp; intimate Sapi attracts those looking for adventure.  The camp is unfenced &amp; overlooks the mighty Zambezi River, filled with hippos &amp; basking crocodiles.  Families with children over 12 are welcome here.

#### Stay
There are only 5 explorer-style tents, 1 of which is a 2-bedroom family unit.  
Each tent features an en-suite bathroom including a bucket shower &amp; flush toilet.  The family tent consists of 2 bedrooms, each with an en-suite bathroom, bucket shower &amp; flush toilet.  There is also a connecting lounge between these rooms.
The main area includes a large communal tent with comfortable sofas that flows out onto a soft beach that leads down to the river.  There is also a small library, well-appointed bar &amp; battery-recharging station. 
Meals are served either inside or alfresco under the stars.

#### Activities
The standard of guiding at Sapi is exceptional.  Expert guides &amp; trackers will take guests on open 4x4 day &amp; night drives, bush walks &amp; canoe safaris down the river.
In addition, Sapi’s Young Explorers Programme offers children a full syllabus of bushcraft skills so that they can learn about animal calls &amp; how to track animals.
