### Little Ruckomechi

#### Experience
Little Ruckomechi is located within the private Ruckomechi Concession &amp; one of only a handful of lodges scattered around Zimbabwe’s Mana Pools National Park.  
The camp offers a true wilderness experience combined with ‘just the right amount’ of luxury.  Adventure seekers who are looking for an off-the-beaten-track safari experience will adore Little Ruckomechi.
Mana Pools is best reached by small plane, so guests can even view the bush from a bird’s eye view – a beautiful vantage point over this under-explored wildlife-rich landscape.
The life-giving Zambezi River is set close to the lodge, offering guests an ‘armchair’ wildlife experience without ever having to leave the lodge.

#### Stay
As the name suggests – Little Ruckomechi is little.  With only 3 tents built of low wooden decks, the stylish en-suite tents are airy &amp; elegant.  For exclusive-use bookings, there are 4 tents available.
The luxurious main open-plan area comprises a sparkling swimming pool overlooking the Zambezi River as well as a bar where delicious cocktails can be enjoyed.

#### Activities
Guests staying at Little Ruckomechi can enjoy open 4x4 game drives, river cruises, canoe safaris, guided nature walks &amp; excellent birding – especially in the green summer season.  
Excellent year-round game viewing can be enjoyed at Mana Pools.
