## Mana Pools National Park
### John's Camp

#### Experience
John’s Camp lies under a canopy of giant trees with views stretching over the Zambezi River floodplains in Mana Pools National Park – a national park &amp; World Heritage Site.
Mana Pools is big game country at its best &amp; has long enjoyed a reputation as one of the country’s best off-the-beaten-track safari destinations.  
As the name suggests, the area has plenty of water year-round – attracting a variety of big game &amp; other wildlife - &amp; therefore providing guests with a fantastic safari experience.
Mana Pools is a fly-in destination that can easily be combined with a trip to Victoria Falls.

#### Stay
Small &amp; intimate, with only 6 tents, John’s Camp offer their guests the best in luxury &amp; adventure camping.  
There are no fences around the camp to allow animals to wander through, which means that John’s Camp accepts children only from the age of 12 unless the camp has been booked on an exclusive-use basis.
Each spacious tent comes complete with solar lighting, en-suite bathrooms &amp; sensational views.
John’s Camp is basic but beautiful &amp; at its centre lies 3 large tents - a kitchen, dining room &amp; lounge – as well as a campfire for chilly evenings.  
The romantic star bed is a pop-up gauze tent built on a raised platform – the camp’s alternative venue for the night.  Sleeping under the African stars should be on everyone’s bucket list!

#### Activities
John’s Camp &amp; Mana Pools offer a variety of exhilarating safari activities, including game drives, guided walking safaris where guests can learn about smaller animals &amp; tracking animals on foot.
The romantic star bed sleep-out is a highlight for the more adventurous guest.
