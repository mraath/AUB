### The Hide Safari Camp

#### Experience
Deep within Zimbabwe’s flagship Hwange National Park, lies The Hide Safari Camp.  
This luxury safari camp with beautiful, tented suites overlooks a busy waterhole with photographic hide - after which the camp has been named.  Here guests can get exceptionally close to the various animals coming down to drink.
Hwange National Park offers superb year-round game viewing with frequent sightings of lion, elephant &amp; white rhino as well as a wide variety of antelope.  Excellent birding can also be expected.

#### Stay
Remote &amp; romantic, there are only 7 deluxe tents (including 2 deluxe family tents), each with a private viewing deck with views over the waterhole, luxurious en-suite bathroom &amp; lounge as well as a glass wood-burning fireplace for chilly winter evenings.
There is also a 3-bedroom family tent called Tom’s Little Hide that is best suited for 6 adults &amp; up to 4 children.  Tom’s Little Hide comes with a private guide &amp; vehicle.
The central area at The Hide Safari Camp includes a swimming pool, bar &amp; dining room.

#### Activities
Morning &amp; afternoon game drives &amp; guided bush walks as well as exciting night drives are offered to The Hide’s guests.  
The park is famous for its large herds of elephants &amp; buffaloes as well as frequent sightings of African wild dog.  Numerous other classic African animals such as giraffe &amp; zebra are easily seen in Hwange &amp; over 400 species of bird species have been recorded.
