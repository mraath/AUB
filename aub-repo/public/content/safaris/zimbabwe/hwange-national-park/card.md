## Zimbabwe
### Hwange National Park

#### Experience
Hwange National Park is not only the largest of Zimbabwe’s national parks but also the most well-known safari destination in the country.
The 15,000 square km Big 5 reserve is home to the second-largest elephant population in the world after the Chobe National Park in Botswana. With 30,000 elephants & a host of predators such as lion, leopard & cheetah – Hwange has become one of Africa’s favourite wildlife reserves.
Some of Africa’s rarer animals such as serval, civet cat, bat-eared fox, African wild dog, black rhino as well as roan & sable antelopes can also be seen here during guided night drives in Hwange National Park.
Hwange National Park boasts decent infrastructure & is easy to access from Victoria Falls, making this a popular choice for a Zimbabwe safari. Alternatively, travellers can also combine Hwange with the wild & rewarding Mana Pools National Park on the Zambezi River.

#### Activities
A variety of safari activities are offered at Hwange National Park.
The highlight is usually exciting open 4x4 game drives with qualified guides - a wonderful chance to get close-up encounters with Africa’s wildlife.
Guests can also enjoy thrilling night drives where they will search for nocturnal animals with a spotlight & explore the bush on foot with expert trackers. Exclusive walking safaris in Zimbabwe provide unique wildlife encounters.
Hwange National Park is not only known to offer superb Big 5 game viewing, great predator sightings & large elephant herds, but guests can also expect to see massive herds of buffalo congregating around water sources during the dry winter months.

#### When to travel
The best time for Big 5 sightings in Hwange is during the dry winter months, from May to October, when wildlife congregates around the shallow pans & man-made waterholes making for excellent & reliable game viewing.
During the rainy season, from late November to April, dry pans fill up & the bush turns into a lush, green paradise. Bird watching is at its best during the wet, summer season.
