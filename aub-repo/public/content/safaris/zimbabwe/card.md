# Zimbabwe
## SAFARIS
### Zimbabwe

#### Experience
The ‘Smoke that Thunders’ is one of the continent’s most mesmerizing sights, leaving visitors in awe & slightly soaked at the same time. The Falls is on the mighty Zambezi River which creates a border between Zimbabwe & Zambia, allowing visitors to view this natural wonder from both sides.
Known as Africa’s adventure capital – the Victoria Falls offers a variety of exciting activities, including scenic helicopter flights, sunset boat cruises, elephant interactions, river rafting & adventurous swims at the edge of the Falls – season dependent.
But the Victoria Falls is not the only reason to visit Zimbabwe. You can enjoy some of Africa’s best big game encounters at Hwange National Park, situated only a stone’s throw from Vic Falls. Mana Pools National Park offers exciting game drives, canoe safaris & guided walks while
Zimbabwe’s lesser well-known destinations offer some unique experiences that make them well worth the effort of getting there. Matusadona National Park set on the shores of Lake Kariba is famous for its rhino, elephant & lion sightings while Malilangwe Wildlife Reserve in Gonarezhou National Park is a haven for big cats, elephants & nearly 400 bird species.

#### Stay
Zimbabwe offers a wide range of accommodations, suited to both the adventurous traveller & the luxury safari enthusiast.
Regardless of if you are staying in a boutique hotel, luxury tented camp or elegant safari lodge – Zimbabwe service is of the highest standard.

#### When to travel
The dry May to October winter season is the best time to visit Zimbabwe for game viewing, although September & October can be very hot.
On the other hand, the best time to visit Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe is at the end of the summer rainy season when the falls are in full flood, between February & July. ‘Low water’ season is between November & early December. During this time there is very little spray, but river rafting & swimming at Devil’s Pool are wonderful activities to enjoy during low season.
