# Tswalu Kalahari Reserve
## South Africa
### Tswalu Kalahari Reserve

#### Experience
Tswalu, located in a privately owned wilderness in the Northern Cape, is the ultimate off-the-beaten-track luxury safari escape &amp is at the forefront of sustainable ecotourism in South Africa.
Tucked away between the Korannaberg mountains &amp grassy, red sand dunes, Tswalu Kalahari Reserve is first &amp foremost a conservation project that funds numerous research projects, geared towards protecting key species within the Kalahari ecosystem.
Apart from staying in opulent Kalahari luxury, guests are guaranteed access to a private vehicle, guide, and tracker – ensuring the freedom and flexibility they so deserve. The cherry on top is that guests have unlimited time at wildlife sightings!
Tswalu Kalahari Reserve is home to two stylish camps: Tswalu The Motse &amp Tswalu Tarkuni, each positioned to take in the wide, open spaces &amp dramatic beauty of the southern Kalahari.

#### Activities
Activities at Tswalu Kalahari are ample!
Guests can enjoy both day &amp night drives, nature walks, animal tracking, horse riding, &amp stargazing. Other exciting activities include dune breakfasts, sleeping out under the stars, &amp spending time with habituated meerkats.

#### When to travel
Tswalu can be visited any time of year, as each of the four Kalahari seasons offers something unique.
During Spring (September to October), meerkat pups venture outside their burrows for the first time as the bush anticipates the beginning of the summer rains.
Summer is the longest &amp most important season. Between November &amp March, days are hot – but the eruption of rain transforms the Kalahari into a carpet of golden flowers &amp green grasses. New life is evident everywhere – from jackal pups to newborn antelopes - &amp birdlife is spectacular.
Autumn is between April &amp May. Days are milder &amp the savanna remains at its greenest. The impala rut reaches its peak while tortoises &amp other reptiles are getting ready to hibernate through the winter.
Winter (June to August) nightly temperatures can be chilly, while days remain pleasantly warm. During this dry season, nocturnal species change their daily routines &amp are often seen above ground, in search of sunshine. This is the best time to spot the elusive species at Tswalu, such as aardvark, aardwolf, &amp pangolin.
