### Leeu Estates

#### Experience
Leeu Estates Franschhoek is set on 100 hectares of vineyards, landscaped gardens &amp; fynbos within the heart of the Cape Winelands – the culinary capital of the country.

A short stroll away, you will find a variety of award-winning restaurants, boutiques, cafes &amp; spectacular wine farms.

Leeu Estates is a refurbished 19th-century Manor House with 6 rooms &amp; suites.  There are 2 rooms adjacent to the Manor House &amp; the remaining rooms &amp; suites are located in spacious cottages among the gardens &amp; vineyards.
At the centre of the estate, you will find the Bokkie Garden – a special place to the founder of Leeu Estates.  The Afrikaans word “bokkie” means small buck, but is also a term used by South Africans, comparable to “sweetheart.” Here in the Bokkie Garden, guests can recharge &amp; reconnect with nature.
