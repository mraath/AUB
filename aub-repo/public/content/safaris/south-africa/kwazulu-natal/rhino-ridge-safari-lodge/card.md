#### Experience

The spacious safari rooms are open plan with private shower rooms opening onto the viewing deck.  The indoor-outdoor design includes glass sliding doors opening onto a private deck with beautiful bushveld views. 
The 2 family safari rooms comprise 2 rooms joined by a common lobby.
Each luxury bush villa features a spacious, open plan lounge, open fireplace &amp; a large viewing deck.  The generous bathroom has a rain shower that opens onto the outdoors, along with a luxurious bathtub with picturesque windows.
Each secluded honeymoon villa is open plan in design &amp; includes an elevated deck with a private plunge pool &amp; a cosy fireplace for cool winter evenings.
The main lodge features a deck that extends along one side of the lodge, an 11-metre infinity lap pool as well as a sundeck &amp; spa.
