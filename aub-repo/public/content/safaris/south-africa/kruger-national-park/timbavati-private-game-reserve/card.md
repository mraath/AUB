### Timbavati Private Game Reserve

#### Experience
The 53,000-hectare Timbavati Private Game Reserve lies on the Kruger National Parks’ unfenced western boundary &amp; - unashamedly - offers some of the best wildlife viewing South Africa!
Created in the 1950s to rehabilitate degraded farmland, the reserve is now fully restored &amp; a haven for the coveted Big 5 – lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo &amp; rhino – as well as a host of other wildlife.  Bird watchers can tick off some of the 360 bird species recorded in the reserve.
The Timbavati offers a wide selection of luxurious safari lodges &amp; tented camps that are suited to all types of travellers, from couples &amp; honeymooners to friends &amp; families.
Being privately owned &amp; run, guests will be able to enjoy off-road driving &amp; spot-lit night drives – activities that are not allowed in the government-owned national park.

#### Activities
Visitors get the opportunity to observe Africa’s magnificent creatures in the wild with twice-daily open 4x4 game drives &amp; nature walks with expert-led guides.  
Game drives take place twice daily - once in the morning &amp; once in the afternoon &amp; evening so that guests have an opportunity to search for nocturnal animals with a spotlight.
Off-road driving will take you straight into the action &amp; ensure wildlife encounters of the highest standard.

#### When to travel
Winter (May to September, also known as the dry season) is the best time for wildlife viewing throughout the region.  Vegetation thins during this time, so wildlife spotting is easy.
April &amp; October are considered shoulder months &amp; are also good for game viewing.  
During the rainy season, December to March – the bush is lush &amp; it turns into a green paradise with sensational birding &amp; plenty of baby animals – favourite prey items for the many Timbavati predators.
