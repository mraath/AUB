## Kruger Private Concession
### Hoyo Hoyo Safari Lodge

#### Experience
An earthy, traditional Tsonga-styled camp, Hoyo Hoyo Safari Lodge offers a unique safari experience on the banks of the Mluwati River in the heart of the Kruger National Park.
Located in a private concession, off-road game driving is permitted &amp; guests can therefore expect close encounters with Africa’s Big 5 in a remote &amp; pristine wilderness environment.
Hoyo Hoyo aims to recreate the ambience of a bygone era, where explorers ventured out into Africa to experience the ultimate adventure.

#### Stay
Luxurious accommodation at Hoyo Hoyo is in 6 circular air-conditioned suites, decorated in vibrant African colours &amp; modern fabrics.  Each hut-type suite includes an en-suite bathroom with antique styled bath, outdoor shower as well as a private viewing deck.
The main area features a comfortable lounge with fireplace, wooden deck area for dining, open-air boma &amp; swimming pool.

#### Activities
Apart from exciting open 4x4 game drives &amp; nature walks, guests will have the opportunity to experience the local Shangaan culture by traditional dance while dining under the Africa stars.  Bush picnics can also be arranged.  
Because the lodge is situated on an ancient elephant route, superb game viewing can be enjoyed from the comfort of the main camp.
