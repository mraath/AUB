### Klaserie Private Game Reserve

#### Experience
The Klaserie Private Game Reserve has earned its bragging rights to being one of the largest privately-owned reserves in South Africa.  
Boasting only a handful of lodges that are scattered across 60,000 hectares, the Klaserie offers guests an authentic &amp; wild safari experience – the way a safari should be.
The reserve is home to the coveted Big 5 – lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo &amp; rhino – as well as an abundance of other wildlife such as giraffe, zebra, impala, warthog, hippo, spotted hyena, baboon, kudu, vervet monkey, waterbuck, wildebeest, bushbaby &amp; mongoose.  
In addition, you may see wild dog, cheetah, bat-eared fox, honey badger, porcupine, aardvark, civet, caracal &amp; serval.
The Klaserie has earned its reputation as offering some of the best walking safaris in the Kruger, so adventurous guests can anticipate plenty of outdoor activities &amp; close-up animal encounters.

#### Activities
Visitors get the opportunity to observe Africa’s magnificent creatures in the wild with twice-daily open 4x4 game drives &amp; nature walks with expert-led guides.  
Game drives take place twice daily - once in the morning &amp; once in the afternoon &amp; evening so that guests have an opportunity to search for nocturnal animals with a spotlight.
Some camps also offer romantic treehouse sleep-outs under the stars – most definitely a bucket list experience!

#### When to travel
Winter (May to September, also known as the dry season) is the best time for wildlife viewing throughout the region.  
Vegetation thins during this time, while animals seeking water congregate at rivers and waterholes, &amp; this only gets better for wildlife watching as the winter goes on. 
April &amp; October are considered shoulder months &amp; are also good for game viewing.  During the rainy season, December to March – the bush is lush &amp; it turns into a birder’s paradise.
