#### Experience
Dulini River boasts a spectacular setting in the world-renowned Sabi Sand Game Reserve, right on the edge of the Sand River.
With a remarkable river location, it is not surprising to spot animals from the comfort of your suite or the lodge’s main viewing deck.

#### Stay
Dulini River consists of 6 elegant &amp; spacious suites with dramatic close-up views of the river.  Each air-conditioned suite is equipped with a beautiful en-suite bathroom with an indoor &amp; outdoor shower as well as a private plunge pool &amp; viewing deck.
The main lodge features a lounge, dining room, swimming pool &amp; large deck area where lazy afternoons can be enjoyed.

#### Activities
Twice daily game drives in open 4x4 safari vehicles will take guests on a journey through the African bushveld &amp; provide close encounters with Africa’s Big 5.  
On the afternoon game drive, a sundowner bush stop is made where guests can enjoy a G&amp;T while watching the sunset.
Nature walks are also possible.  Expert guides &amp; Shangaan trackers will accompany guests on all activities &amp; teach them how to track animals on foot.
