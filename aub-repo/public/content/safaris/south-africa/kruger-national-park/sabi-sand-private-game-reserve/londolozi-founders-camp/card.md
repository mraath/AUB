### Londolozi Founders Camp

#### Experience
Londolozi Founders Camp is located within the heart of the world-renowned Sabi Sand Reserve in the Greater Kruger region.
The root of the word ‘Londolozi’ is the Zulu word for protect &amp; means ‘protector of all living things’ – therefore a strong emphasis is placed on conservation &amp; sensitivity to nature.

#### Stay
Londolozi Founders Camp consists of 10 superior chalets, of which 5 chalets are stand-alone units, 3 are family units &amp; 2 are inter-leading units.
Shaded by a tree line, all chalets are set along the Sand River, allowing for possible game viewing opportunities from the privacy of your room.  Each chalet has a private verandah with magnificent river views.
The 5 stand-alone superior chalets are ideal for honeymooners or couples.  These chalets have private decks, salas &amp; plunge pools.
The 3 family units consist of 2 bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms &amp; are ideal for parents travelling with 2 children.
The 2 superior inter-leading chalets are linked by a skywalk &amp; this rooming option works well for families of 4 or families of 3.  
The main area features a dining room, thatched game viewing deck &amp; riverside lounge where guests can relax while sipping a sundowner cocktail.
