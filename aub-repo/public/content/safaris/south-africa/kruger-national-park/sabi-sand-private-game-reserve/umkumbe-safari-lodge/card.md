# Umkumbe Safari Lodge
## Sabi Sand Private Game Reserve
### Umkumbe Safari Lodge

#### Experience
Umkumbe Safari Lodge is located on the banks of the Sand River in the Sabi Sand Reserve, a private concession right next to the Kruger National Park.
A typical home-away-from-home camp, Umkumbe is the kind of place where you can enjoy the comforts of the bush without spending an arm &amp; a leg on an authentic safari experience.

#### Stay
Umkumbe consists of only 10 rooms &amp; suites, most of which have fantastic views of the Sand River or waterhole.  There are 7 superior suites &amp; 3 standard rooms.
The 7 superior suites each feature a king-size bed plus a 2-sleeper sofa &amp; an en-suite bathroom with a  bath &amp; outdoor shower.  Two of these suites are inter-leading, making it a good option for families travelling together.  Four of the suites overlook the Sand River, while 3 suites look onto a small plains area with a waterhole.
The 3 standard rooms each have an en-suite bathroom with shower &amp; 2 of them are inter-leading.  All standard rooms face the Sand River.
The main lodge features a comfortable open-plan lounge with a viewing deck &amp; swimming pool where guests can cool off after a day out in the bush.

#### Activities
Daily safari activities at Umkumbe Safari Lodge include open 4x4 game drives &amp; guided bush walks for the adventurous at heart.
Professional rangers &amp; trackers will accompany you on each activity &amp; ensure close encounters with Africaâ€™s Big 5 &amp; general game.  This part of the Sabi Sand Reserve offers excellent wildlife viewing year-round.
