### Londolozi Tree Camp

#### Experience
Londolozi Tree Camp is located within the world-renowned Sabi Sand Game Reserve, a private wildlife sanctuary adjacent to the Kruger National Park.
Rated by many as one of Africa’s most beautiful lodges, Londolozi Tree Camp takes the name from an ancient Ebony tree shading the main deck.

#### Stay
The camp accommodates guests in 6 private suites, each featuring an en-suite bathroom &amp; private deck overlooking the Sand River &amp; African bush.
The main area consists of a large wooden deck, built on high stilts off the ground.  This elevated position often allows for excellent wildlife sightings from the comfort of the lodge.  
Guests can have a massage, relax at the bar, use the nearby gym or cool off in the lap pool.

#### Activities
Activities at Londolozi is action-packed!  Qualified rangers &amp; trackers will accompany guests on open 4x4 game drives through the Sabi Sand Game Reserve, in search of some of Africa’s wildest animals.

Guests can also use the fitness room or book a photographic safari course at an additional cost.
