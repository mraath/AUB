## Sabi Sand Private Game Reserve
### Arathusa Safari Lodge

#### Experience
Arathusa Safari Lodge lies in the world-renowned Sabi Sand Reserve, adjacent to the Kruger National Park in South Africa.
The lodge is built on the edge of a waterhole where plenty of animal activity takes place.  Guests at Arathusa are treated to an exceptional wildlife experience, including the prized Big 5 â€“ lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo &amp; rhino.

#### Stay
Arathusa has 9 waterhole suites &amp; 4 bush suites.  The waterhole suites are built close to the waterhole where guests can enjoy prime game viewing opportunities from the comfort of their viewing decks. 
The bush suites are built further away from the main area, with absolute privacy &amp; seclusion in mind.  These suites are more spacious &amp; each is equipped with a private plunge pool &amp; lounge area.  
All 13 suites have an en-suite bathroom with a shower as well as a private outdoor shower &amp; veranda.
The main area features a comfortable lounge, a swimming pool overlooking the bush &amp; an open-air dining area.

#### Activities
Daily activities at Arathusa include safari drives in open 4x4 vehicles, where guests will be accompanied by a qualified ranger &amp; tracker.  Offering a unique insight into life after dark, night drives allow you to spot an entirely different cast of animals.
Walking safaris are exciting as guests will learn about fauna &amp; flora as well as tracking animals on foot.
