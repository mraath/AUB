### Sanbona Wildlife Reserve

#### Experience
Tucked away at the foot of the majestic Warmwaterberg Mountains in the Little Karoo lies the malaria-free Sanbona Wildlife Reserve.
Nestled in 58,000 hectares of Cape Fold Mountains &amp boundless plains, Sanbona Wildlife Reserve is the Western Cape’s top Big 5 game viewing destination.
Situated only a 3-hour drive from the iconic city of Cape Town, Sanbona is the ideal choice for couples, families, or friends looking for an unforgettable safari close to the Mother City.
Here, guests will experience a huge diversity of indigenous fauna &amp flora, rare examples of San rock art, &amp exciting land &amp water-based activities.

#### Activities
Sanbona Wildlife Reserve offers the best of both worlds.
A range of exciting activities is available, including open 4x4 game drives, boat safaris on the Bellair Dam (subject to water levels), wilderness walks, stargazing, bird watching, &amp visits to San rock art sites.
Each of the lodges at Sanbona has a Relaxation Retreat that offers a wide range of indulging spa treatments – the ideal post-safari treat.
Sanbona welcomes kids on safari! Their family lodge, Sanbona Gondwana, has special children’s programs &amp activities that will keep the little ones entertained from beginning to end!

#### When to travel
With an arid to semi-arid climate, Sanbona’s wildlife viewing isn’t much influenced by the seasons, which makes this an ideal year-round safari destination.
Between May &amp September, daytime temperatures are pleasant, and wildlife viewing is at its best. (Morning &amp night temperatures are cold, so warm clothing is necessary.)
Between October &amp April, temperatures are high, plenty of newborn animals can be found, &amp migrant birds are present.
