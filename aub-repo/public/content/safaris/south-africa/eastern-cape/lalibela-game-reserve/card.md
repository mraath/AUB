# Lalibela Game Reserve
## Eastern Cape
### Lalibela Game Reserve

#### Experience
Lalibela Game Reserve is located within South Africa’s Eastern Cape province &amp; although small in comparison with other South African reserves, it is the only one in the Eastern Cape without a public road running through its property.
The malaria-free Lalibela encompasses 5 eco-systems, resulting in a breathtaking diversity of fauna &amp; flora.  Home to the famous Big 5 – lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo &amp; rhino – as well as other predators like cheetah, hyena, jackal &amp; lynx – Lalibela never disappoints when it comes to wildlife viewing.
Lalibela Game Reserve places a strong focus on conservation, wildlife viewing, luxury &amp; great food – the most important safari ingredients, by far!
With its accessible location (a 60-minute drive from Port Elizabeth), breathtaking scenery and Big 5 game viewing, Lalibela is the perfect safari add-on to a trip along South Africa’s world-famous Garden Route.

#### Activities
Lalibela Game Reserve offers a variety of exciting safari activities.
Guests visiting Lalibela can expect to see a variety of game during their time on safari.  Twice daily game drives in open 4x4 vehicles will ensure excellent photographic opportunities &amp; close wildlife encounters.  
Daily walking safaris &amp; animal tracking with expert-led guides will bring guests closer to nature. 
Some of the family-friendly safari lodges include Kids Clubs that offer a bunch of exciting activities for the little ones, including special game drives, arts &amp; crafts &amp; African stories.  These lodges also offer special child-friendly food &amp; babysitting during adult dinner times &amp; game drives.
