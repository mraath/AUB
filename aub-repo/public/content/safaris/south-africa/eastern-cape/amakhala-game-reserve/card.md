# Amakhala Game Reserve
## Eastern Cape
### Amakhala Game Reserve

#### Experience
Situated in the malaria-free Eastern Cape &amp; under an hour’s drive from Port Elizabeth, Amakhala Game Reserve is home to the Big 5 – lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo &amp; rhino – as well as cheetah, giraffe, zebra &amp; wildebeest.
Amakhala was created in 1999 as a joint conservation initiative between the owners of 6 lodges to allow for the reintroduction of wild animals to a region in which they once roamed freely.  Today, Amakhala has placed itself on South Africa’s map of top malaria-free Big 5 wildlife destinations – quite the accolade!
Guests can choose from a selection of accommodations that are scattered throughout the 8,500-hectare reserve, including restored country houses, safari lodges &amp; tented camps.
With such close proximity to Port Elizabeth, Amakhala is a wonderful safari destination to add to your self-drive Garden Route itinerary.

#### Activities
Since the Bushman’s River cuts through the reserve, Amakhala offers a variety of exciting land &amp; water-based safari activities.
Guests can enjoy open 4x4 game drives in search of big game as well as expert-led walking safaris.  Other fun-filled activities include boating &amp; canoe safaris on the river, romantic picnics, bush dinners, bird watching &amp; interesting cultural tours.
Twice daily game drives include morning safaris &amp; night safaris where guests will search for nocturnal animals with spotlight – quite the adventure!

#### When to travel
In Amakhala, the wildlife viewing is good all year. 
Since the climate is semi-arid, animals are always attracted to water sources – but marginally more so during the driest months of June through September.  Nights become very cold at this time, making it essential to bring warm clothing for game drives in open vehicles.
The weather is warmer between October to March.
