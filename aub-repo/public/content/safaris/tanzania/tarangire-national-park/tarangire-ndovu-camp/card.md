### Tarangire Ndovu Camp

#### Experience
Tarangire Ndovu Camp is situated in the heart of Tarangire National Park – Tanzania’s lesser-visited but more intriguing park on the northern safari circuit.
The park is famed for its rare tree-climbing lions as well as large herds of elephants &amp; buffaloes.  The odd-looking long-necked gerenuk can also be seen here.  
In the dry season between June &amp; October, the Tarangire River becomes the area’s main lifeline, attracting an abundance of wildlife, including predators &amp; birds.  During this time, game viewing becomes second-to-none!

#### Stay

Each canvas tent is spacious &amp; generously furnished with the entire front zipping open to reveal the Tarangire landscape.  The en-suite bathrooms are equipped with a  ceramic washbasin with running water, a flush toilet &amp; a safari-style hot water bucket shower.
The guest areas include an open-plan lounge, dining &amp; bar area that leads you to a beautiful rim-flow pool, offering sweeping views over the plains &amp; Great Rift Valley wall.
