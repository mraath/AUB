## Tanzania
### Tarangire National Park

#### Experience
Tarangire National Park, one of Tanzania's best-kept secrets, offers a unique safari experience.
While many travelers flock to Tanzania's famous destinations like the Serengeti &amp Ngorongoro Crater, Tarangire National Park remains a hidden gem. This pristine wilderness is renowned for its tree-climbing lions, large elephant herds, impressive predator sightings, &amp exceptional birdwatching. Unique species like the long-necked gerenuk &amp rare fringed-eared oryx call this park home.
During the dry season, Tarangire comes alive with wildlife, drawing migratory animals like wildebeest, zebra, common eland, hartebeest, gazelle, buffalo, &amp numerous elephant herds to the Tarangire River.

#### Activities
Tarangire National Park offers a wealth of activities, ensuring an exciting stay. Choose from day &amp night game drives, guided walks, thrilling balloon safaris, immersive fly-camping experiences, cultural village visits, picturesque sundowner excursions, enchanting bush dinners, &amp day trips to nearby Lake Manyara or Ngorongoro Crater.

#### When to travel
For the best wildlife viewing, visit during the dry season from late June to October when the Tarangire River attracts a profusion of wildlife. During November &amp December, the short rains disperse many animals, but January &amp February provide dry conditions. March to May ushers in the wet season, with heavy rains rendering much of the park inaccessible &amp most camps closed.
