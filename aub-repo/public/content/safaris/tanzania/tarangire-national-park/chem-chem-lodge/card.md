### Chem Chem Lodge

#### Experience
With an ideal location in a private concession between Tarangire &amp; Lake Manyara National Parks, Chem Chem Lodge boasts jaw-dropping views over the lake itself.
The Chem Chem concession is known for its large herds of buffaloes &amp; elephants, so guests can enjoy thrilling wildlife encounters mixed with utter relaxation.  The pace here echoes the Swahili saying, ‘Pole, pole’, which means ‘Slowly, slowly!’  No need to hurry here.
Owner-managed &amp; run, Chem Chem provides only the best in safari hospitality.

#### Stay
There are 8 spacious, ultra-luxurious tent-style suites at Chem Chem Lodge, of which 1 is a two-bedroom family suite.
Each tent is 100 sq metres &amp; designed with the utmost privacy in mind.  Your nearest neighbour is at least 80 metres away.  The tents have luxurious bathtubs, outdoor showers, reading corners &amp; private patios with salas &amp; exercise mats.
The family unit consists of a full suite connected to a vintage-style tent with an en-suite shower.  It can sleep 2 adults &amp; 3 children.
Tastefully decorated, the main lodge houses a lounge, bar &amp; library area as well as a dining room, outdoor boma, spa &amp; swimming pool overlooking a busy waterhole.

#### Activities
Safari activities include day &amp; night game drives, guided walking safaris in the private concession, bird watching – including sightings of thousands of flamingos - &amp; thrilling hot air balloon safaris.
