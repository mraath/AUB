### Tarangire Treetops

#### Experience
Tarangire Treetops fulfils our ultimate childhood dream!  Set on a hill with sweeping views to Lake Manyara &amp; the Rift Valley wall, these luxurious treehouses remind us of our inner child.
Situated directly on the path of an annual migration, the camp sits alone in a community wildlife area bordering Tanzania’s Tarangire National Park.
The reserve is home to an abundance of wildlife, including lion, cheetah, leopard, buffalo &amp; elephant.
Their safari-style Boabab Bar is built around a gracious old baobab tree &amp; invites guests to enjoy a refreshing cocktail while taking in the glorious Tarangire sunset.

#### Stay
There are 20 treehouse suites, each 65 sq meters – one of the largest bedrooms to be found in any camp in East Africa!  
Each open-fronted suite features an en-suite bathroom with a double shower &amp; a secluded balcony affording sweeping views across the Tarangire plains during sunrise &amp; sunset.  
Even more special – guests can sit on their private balcony &amp; watch wildlife drink from the waterhole in front of camp!
The main lodge is wrapped around an ancient Baobab tree &amp; features an expansive deck with an open-sided lounge &amp; dining area.  Below is a second deck with a sparkling swimming pool – the perfect place to relax after a day in the bush.

#### Activities
A range of exciting safari activities is available at Tarangire River Camp.
These include open 4x4 day &amp; night drives, guided walking safaris, romantic sundowner excursions, Maasai village visits &amp; home-cooked picnics served with extraordinary views over the Tarangire plains.
