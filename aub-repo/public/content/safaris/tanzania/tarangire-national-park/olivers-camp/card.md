## Tarangire National Park
### Oliver's Camp

#### Experience
Oliver’s Camp is situated in the secluded south-eastern sector of Tarangire National Park &amp; offers an off-the-beaten-track safari experience with superior service &amp; excellent guiding.
Truly authentic, the camp is set in a remote, uncrowded sector of Tarangire:  home to the renowned tree-climbing lions, large herds of elephants &amp; the unusual long-necked gerenuk. 
Wildlife viewings are always wonderful – especially between August &amp; October when the bush is dry &amp; large concentrations of animals are found at the nearby water sources.
Oliver’s Camp also specializes in walking safaris with expert guides.  There is nothing quite like exploring the remote corners of the bush on foot.

#### Stay
The camp boasts 10 luxury-suite tents, including a 4-sleeper family tent.
Each thatched-roof tent features a lovely outdoor shower with glorious views of the surrounding landscape &amp; a private wooden deck with a relaxing day bed.
The family tent is larger than usual &amp; specifically designed to accommodate 2 adults &amp; 2 children.  This unit also has an outdoor shower with bush views.
The thatched main area at Oliver’s Camp houses an elegantly furnished lounge, dining area &amp; bar that leads out onto the front deck &amp; outdoor fireplace where guests can enjoy pre-dinner drinks or gaze up at the canopy of stars.

#### Activities
A range of exciting safari activities is available at Oliver’s Camp.
These include open 4x4 day &amp; night drives with qualified guides, guided walking safaris &amp; thrilling hot air balloon safaris over the vast African plains.
