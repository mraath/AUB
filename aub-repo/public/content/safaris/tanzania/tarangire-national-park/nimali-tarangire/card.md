### Nimali Tarangire

#### Experience
Nimali Tarangire is set on the banks of a seasonal river in a private reserve adjoining Tarangire National Park in Tanzania.
Discerning travellers seeking a private &amp; unspoilt safari experience will fall in love with Nimali Tarangire - a luxury safari haven surrounded by an untouched landscape.
The park is famed for its tree-climbing lions, large elephant herds &amp; the unusual long-necked gerenuk which can stand on its hind legs for minutes at a time to reach fresh leaves.  
The area is also home to a substantial amount of predators &amp; over 500 bird species.
This boutique-style camp is small enough to ensure personalized service, a quality that often attracts honeymooners or romantics who require a little extra care to make lasting memories.
Families are also happy at Nimali Tarangire as they provide baby cots &amp; high chairs for those travelling with infants.

#### Stay
This intimate camp consists of 10 stylish tents raised on wooden decks, with beautiful views of the seasonal riverbed &amp; dramatic boulders beneath.
Two of the tents have been designed with families in mind, so are linked together &amp; share a small plunge pool.
Each contemporary tent features an en-suite bathroom with revitalizing rain shower &amp; private deck – the perfect place to relax after a game drive or for sipping your morning coffee bought to your tent as part of your morning wake-up call.
The central area includes a cosy lounge, dining room, bar &amp; library that looks over a waterhole often frequented by wildlife.  Outside, you will find a large deck with a swimming pool &amp; a cosy fire-pit boma.

#### Activities
Activities include day &amp; night drives, guided walks, balloon safaris, fly-camping, village visits, sundowner excursions, bush dinners &amp; day trips to Lake Manyara or Ngorongoro Crater.
