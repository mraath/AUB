### Beho Beho Camp

#### Experience
Set in the remote Nyerere National Park (Selous Game Reserve), Beho Beho Camp enjoys a spectacular setting on the slopes of the Namikwera Hill, overlooking the Rufiji River floodplain.
Nyerere is truly one of the most magical places in Africa &amp; covers an area of over 11,000 square miles, more than twice the size of the Serengeti!  
Not only will you discover an array of varying biodiversity – from forests &amp; woodlands to savanna plains &amp; wetlands – you will also be exploring one of Africa’s largest big game populations, including the big cats &amp; major predators.
Owned by the Bailey family for over 40 years, guests will experience a warm welcome &amp; exceptional service.

#### Stay
Small &amp; intimate, Beho Beho has only 8 unique bandas that are built from stone &amp; palm leaves, quite different from the tented accommodation one might find across Tanzania.  
In addition, the lodge also features the exclusive &amp; luxurious Bailey’s Banda, a 2-bedroom private villa for families or friends looking for the ultimate safari hideaway.
There are 4 bandas on one side of the main house &amp; 4 on the other, creating an intimate home-away-from-home atmosphere.
Each banda features an en-suite bathroom with an open-air shower as well as a private veranda offering breathtaking views over the wilderness.
The main area includes a well-stocked bar, a large veranda overlooking a waterhole as well as a crystal-clear pool with beautiful views.

#### Activities
Activities include open 4x4 game drives, walking safaris &amp; boating on Lake Tagalala – the perfect place to enjoy close encounters with the resident hippos &amp; crocodiles.
An overnight treehouse sleep-out can also be arranged for stays of 4 nights or longer.
