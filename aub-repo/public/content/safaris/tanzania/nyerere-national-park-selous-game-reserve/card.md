### Nyerere National Park (Selous Game Reserve)

#### Experience
Nyerere National Park, previously known as Selous Game Reserve, stands as Africa's largest standalone national park, sprawling over 30,000 square kilometers in southern Tanzania. What sets it apart is its ability to attract fewer visitors compared to its northern counterparts.
Nyerere National Park boasts pristine and untouched landscapes, offering visitors an authentic safari experience in one of Africa's last remaining wildernesses. A standout feature is the allowance for off-road driving, enabling visitors to get up close and personal with the area's resident wildlife.

#### Activities
One of the most sought-after activities in Nyerere National Park is extended treks through the bush, with overnight fly-camps along the way—an adventure traveler's dream come true! Permanent lodges in the area offer a range of exciting activities, including open 4x4 game drives &amp boating safaris along the Rufiji River. Guests can also indulge in guided walking safaris, bird watching, bush breakfasts, &amp romantic sundowner excursions.

#### When to travel
For the best wildlife viewing experience in Nyerere National Park, plan your visit between June &amp October during the dry season when animals congregate at water sources, &amp the thinner vegetation makes animal spotting easier. While the wet season, from October to May, paints the scenery lush &amp green, afternoons can become unbearably hot. Note that many lodges close their doors between March &amp May.
