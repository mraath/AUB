# Kigelia Ruaha
## Ruaha National Park
### Kigelia Ruaha

#### Experience
Kigelia Ruaha – named after the distinctive sausage tree, Kigelia Africana – is set within a grove of these botanical oddities on the banks of the Ifuguru Sand River in Tanzania’s Ruaha National Park.
Ruaha is one of Tanzania’s most remote safari destinations.  The national park is one of the largest, yet least visited areas in the country – which means that travellers who visit are surrounded by an abundance of wildlife, birds &amp; spectacular landscapes.
Famed for hosting some of Africa’s largest concentrations of lion, elephant &amp; buffalo – Ruaha never fails to impress.  Frequent wild dog sightings can also be expected.

#### Stay
The camp is small &amp; intimate, offering a total of 5 safari tents &amp; 1 family tent.
Each tent is large &amp; airy, featuring an en-suite bathroom complete with a safari-style bucket shower under the stars.  
The family tent comprises 2 adjoining en-suite bedrooms.
Communal areas include a large deck where dinners are served, a well-stocked library &amp; a crackling campfire – the perfect spot to enjoy pre-dinner drinks or share interesting safari stories.

#### Activities
Safari activities at Kigelia Ruaha include daily morning &amp; afternoon game drives in open-sided 4x4 vehicles &amp; thrilling night drives in search of nocturnal animals.  
Adventurous guests can also enjoy guided walking safaris to learn more about local fauna &amp; flora.
