## Ruaha National Park
### Ikuka Safari Camp

#### Experience
Perched on the edge of the Mwagusi escartment in Ruaha National Park, Ikuka Safari Camp offers breathtaking views across the Ruaha Valley in Tanzania.
Owner-managed &amp; run, Ikuka is an ideal choice for adventurous travellers looking to explore the wild &amp; remote corners of Africa without compromising on modern-day comforts.
Ikuka Safari Camp can only be reached by plane, usually access from Dar es Salaam.  It is open all year, except April &amp; May during the heavy rain season, &amp; combines well with safari destinations such as Selous Game Reserve or beach destinations like Zanzibar.

#### Stay
Comprised of just 6 beautifully appointed open-sided luxury tents &amp; 1 family villa, all enjoy panoramic vistas of the Ruaha wilderness.
Each tent has an en-suite bathroom.  One of these tents also boasts a private plunge pool.  
The double story family unit sleeps 2 adults downstairs &amp; 3 children upstairs, sharing a bathroom, sitting room, pool deck &amp; plunge pool.
The camp’s communal areas include a lounge, dining area &amp; a well-stocked bar as well as an outdoor pool &amp; sundeck.  A flight of stairs take you to a cosy library with a variety of interesting books.

#### Activities
The focus at Ikuka Safari Camp is on twice-daily game drives during the morning or afternoon.
Guided walking safaris are a great opportunity to discover the smaller details of the bush that you may miss while on a game drive.  Often guests encounter elephant, impala, kudu &amp; giraffe on foot.
