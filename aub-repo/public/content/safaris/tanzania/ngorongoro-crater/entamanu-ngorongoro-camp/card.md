### Entamanu Ngorongoro Camp

#### Experience
Entamanu Ngorongoro boasts a secluded setting at the edge of the crater’s rim at roughly 3,000 feet above sea level.
Tanzania’s Ngorongoro Crater is the country’s most famous landmark &amp; the largest intact volcanic caldera in the world.  And in 2015 it was officially hailed as one of the Seven Natural Wonders of Africa.  
At Entamanu, guests can witness the ever-changing landscape of the Serengeti to the west &amp; the Crater to the east.

#### Stay
Entamanu Ngorongoro offers an intimate safari experience with only 7 spacious, elegant suites - of which 2 are family units.  All have en-suite facilities.
Although the high altitude can bring some challenges – like extremely warm days or chilly evenings – the suites have been carefully designed to give guests the most comfortable &amp; relaxing safari experience.
Down duvets &amp; heaters provide warmth against chilly nights &amp; fully openable fronts can let the breeze in when it warms up during the day.  Each suite features a wrap-around veranda offering glorious views over the crater.
The main lodge with lounge, dining area &amp; bar boasts a spectacular position on the remote north-western edge of the crater rim, affording views over either side of the crater wall.

#### Activities
Entamanu Ngorongoro Camp offers a wide range of thrilling safari activities.
These include open 4x4 game drives in the Ngorongoro Crater – one of Africa’s most iconic wildlife destinations as well as guided walks along the rim of the crater &amp; surrounding highlands with a local Maasai warrior.
Cultural tours to a nearby Maasai village can also be arranged for those interested to learn more about their way of life.
