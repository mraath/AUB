### Mila Tented Camp

#### Experience
Surrounded by acacia trees &amp; massive granite boulders, Mila Tented Camp is set within the 126,000- acre Mwiba Wildlife Reserve, a private park that forms part of the southern Serengeti.
There are 5 natural springs that flow into camp, attracting an abundance of thirsty game.  This spectacular wildlife show can be witnessed from the comfort of the tented suites.
Mila Tented Camp &amp; the southern Serengeti also offer guests the rare opportunity to witness mass wildebeest calving, along with plenty of predator action during the beginning of the year.

The main mess tent includes a comfortable lounge &amp; dining area that leads to an outdoor campfire setting.
Guests will have access to the facilities at the nearby Mila Lodge, which includes a swimming pool &amp; spa.

#### Activities
Since each group is assigned a private safari vehicle &amp; guide, guests can explore the bush at their own pace.
