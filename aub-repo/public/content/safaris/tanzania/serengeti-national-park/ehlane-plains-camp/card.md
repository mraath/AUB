# Ehlane Plains Camp
## Serengeti National Park
### Ehlane Plains Camp

#### Experience
‘Ehlane’ means ‘wilderness’ in the Zulu language, &amp; aptly so – because Ehlane Plains Camp lies deep in the heart of the eastern Serengeti, surrounded by endless savannas.
Each year between October &amp; December, this vast wilderness is covered in large herds of wildebeest, zebra &amp; other antelope on their epic migratory journey through this part of Tanzania.
During the Great Wildebeest Migration, resident predators such as lion, cheetah &amp; spotted hyena are active - promising exceptional predator-prey interactions.
Not only does Ehlane Plains Camp offer front row seats to one of Africa’s most iconic wildlife spectacles, it also promises year-round game viewing of the highest quality.
The camp is unfenced &amp; completely open to passing wildlife, ensuring exceptional armchair game viewing from the comfort of the viewing deck.

#### Stay
The camp offers 4 luxury safari tents, 2 ‘star dome’ tents &amp; 2 family tents, all designed to blend in with the rugged landscape – under canvas &amp; with clear vistas of the surrounding wilderness.  
Each tent contains an en-suite bathroom &amp; lounge cove with comfortable sofas where lazy afternoons can be spent.
The ‘star dome’ tents have been designed with open rooftops to recline on large cushions &amp; fall asleep beneath a natural planetarium.  
The family tents welcome families of up to 5 in inter-connected suites.  The family unit includes a private lounge with a cushion-covered floor where families can relax, read or play games.
The main lodge includes a lounge &amp; dining area with a cosy campfire where pre-dinner drinks can be enjoyed.

#### Activities
Activities at Ehlane Plains Camp include open 4x4 game drives, walking trips &amp; hot air balloon safaris over the vast Serengeti plains.
