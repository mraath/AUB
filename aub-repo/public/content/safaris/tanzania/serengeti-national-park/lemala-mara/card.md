### Lemala Mara

#### Experience
Lemala Mara is a mobile tented camp that moves around the plains of the Serengeti, in pursuit of one of Earth’s greatest wildlife spectacles:  The Great Wildebeest Migration.
With a careful eye on the migration route, the camp is pitched in the game-rich Ndutu area between December &amp; March, then moves to the crocodile-infested Mara River in the northern Serengeti between June &amp; October.
During this time, the camp is situated close to the river’s popular crossing points, yet tucked away from the busy roads, which means that guests will have more privacy &amp; access to additional river crossing points with better viewing opportunities.
Small &amp; intimate, the camp aims to provide an authentic safari experience where personal attention &amp; warm service is of top priority.

#### Stay
There are 12 luxury safari tents at Lemala Mara, each equipped with an en-suite bathroom.  Seven of these are standard tents, 3 are quadruple tents &amp; 2 are two-bedroom family units.
The luxury tents are spacious &amp; comfortable, offering an outside deck with beautiful views over the bush.  These tents can sleep 2 guests.
The quadruple tents are identical to the standard tents, with the only difference being the ability to put extra beds in.  These tents can sleep 4 people.
The family tents consist of 2 interconnected bedrooms, located on either side of a shared lounge to which one can enjoy sundowners or early morning coffee.  These units can sleep 6 guests.
The communal area located in a mess tent includes a lounge, dining space, central bar, library &amp; Kids Club. Pre-dinner drinks are often enjoyed around the crackling campfire.

#### Activities
Safari activities include open 4x4 game drives in open safari vehicles, hot air balloon safaris over the Serengeti plains, outdoor dining &amp; romantic sundowner excursions.
The little ones can also enjoy a range of fun-filled activities at the Kids Club.
