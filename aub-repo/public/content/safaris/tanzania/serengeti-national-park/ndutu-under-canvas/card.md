## Serengeti National Park
### Ndutu Under Canvas

#### Experience
Ndutu Under Canvas is a luxury mobile tented camp that follows the movements of one of Earth’s greatest wildlife spectacles:  The Great Wildebeest Migration. 
The camp’s 3 annual locations vary between the centre &amp; southern regions of the Serengeti, depending on the activity of the migration. (December – March)
Ndutu Under Canvas promises superb sightings of wildebeest herds as they pass through Tanzania’s Serengeti National Park in search of greener pastures.
Safari-goers who are looking for an authentic, tented safari experience where the emphasis is on thrilling wildlife encounters (&amp; not fancy robes &amp; slippers) will fall in love with Ndutu!

#### Stay
Authenticity itself, Ndutu Under Canvas ensures that the camp has minimal impact on the environment &amp; therefore its 10 safari tents embrace elegant safari simplicity.  One of these tents is a family unit.
Guests won’t be at a loss for modern comforts, though.  Each safari tent has an en-suite bathroom with a hot water bucket shower &amp; flush toilet.  From the comfort of the bed, guests can enjoy glorious views over the sun-kissed plains.
The main area at Ndutu comprises 2 tents that function as a dining room &amp; lounge where guests can relax, enjoy a meal or unwind with a glass of wine.

#### Activities
The camp is unfenced to the environment, so wildlife can move around as they please.  There are guards on watch 24-hours a day, so guests can relax knowing that animals keep a safe distance.
Safari activities at the various locations include open 4x4 game drives, bush dining, romantic sundowner excursions &amp; walks to the Ngorongoro Crater &amp; Olduvai Gorge.
