KasKaz Mara is set near the game-rich Mara River &amp; it is here where the annual Wildebeest Migration crosses from the depleted plains of Serengeti National Park to the lush grasslands of the Masai Mara.
Each year, guests can witness this grand spectacle as millions of wildebeest, zebra &amp; gazelle brave the Mara River in search of greener pastures.
In addition, the Serengeti offers superb year-round wildlife viewing &amp; is home to iconic species like lion, wild dog, rhino, elephant, hippo &amp; crocodile.
