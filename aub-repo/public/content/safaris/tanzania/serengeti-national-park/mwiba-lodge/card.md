## Serengeti National Park
### Mwiba Lodge

#### Experience
Set in a 126,000-acre private concession deep within the heart of the southern Serengeti, Mwiba Lodge is nestled discreetly among gigantic boulders with views over the Arugusinyai River.
Ultra-luxurious Mwiba Lodge offers exquisite interiors, jaw-dropping views, sublime cuisine &amp; thrilling wildlife encounters, making this a safari that is hard to beat!
During the calving season in the southern Serengeti, guests are fortunate enough to witness millions of wildebeest &amp; their young graze from the lush, green grass before moving on to the next phase of their migration.

#### Stay
Mwiba Lodge boasts 10 luxurious tented suites, each featuring a comfortable seating area &amp; an en-suite bathroom complete with a lavish bathtub, an outdoor deck &amp; an indoor &amp; outdoor shower.
Of the 10 tented suites, 2 pairs are adjoining &amp; suitable to accommodate guests who are travelling together.   Suite Nr 2 &amp; Nr 3 connect, as do Suite Nr 8 &amp; Nr 9.  These suites are connected by wooden walkways to allow easy access between the suites, making them ideal for families with younger children.  
Toddlers are smaller kids would be better suited to stay in adjoining suites 8 &amp; 9, since the other adjoining suites are somewhat exposed &amp; can therefore not be left unattended.  
If a triple configuration is required, the sofa in the tent’s lounge area can be made up as an additional bed.  The lodge also has a portable cot with a mosquito net.
The main building houses a lounge, dining room, bar &amp; library &amp; outside you will find a timber deck with an infinity pool that boasts wonderful views over the natural springs below.  There is also a gym room for guests who want to work off the decadent safari food served up by the chefs.

#### Activities
At Mwiba Lodge, guests are assigned a private safari guide &amp; vehicle – ensuring an intimate safari experience, without adhering to a set safari schedule.
Safari activities at Mwiba Lodge include open 4x4 game drives, night drives, guided bush walks, sundowner excursions, village visits, helicopter flights, in-room spa treatments &amp; fly-camping expeditions.
