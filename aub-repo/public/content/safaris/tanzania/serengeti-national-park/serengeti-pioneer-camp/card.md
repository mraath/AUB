#### Experience
The game-rich southern Serengeti is the setting for Pioneer Camp, ideally situated to offer jaw-dropping views of the Moru Kopjes with its Maasai rock art &amp; Lake Magadi, a favourite sundowner spot.
Paying homage to the traditional mobile camps of the 1930s, Serengeti Pioneer Camp still offers ample style &amp; luxurious touches.  
Each year, safari enthusiasts visit the Serengeti to witness one of Earth’s greatest wildlife spectacles:  The Great Wildebeest Migration. 
Ideally located, Serengeti Pioneer Camp not only offers superb access to observe this magical wildlife show but also provides phenomenal Big 5 game viewing year-round.

The spacious family tent comprises 2 en-suite bedrooms adjoined by a sitting room.
The communal space includes an elevated viewing lounge, dining area, bar &amp; swimming pool.
