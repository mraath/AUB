## Serengeti National Park
### Legendary Serengeti Camp

#### Experience
Moving location 3 times each year, Legendary Serengeti Mobile Camp follows one of Africaâ€™s greatest wildlife spectacles:  The Great Wildebeest Migration.
Between July &amp; November, the camp is pitched in the northern Serengeti to view the dramatic river crossings &amp; between December &amp; April the camp moves to the southern Serengeti for the lush green season, with calving happening around January.  From May to July, the camp reaches the plains of the western Serengeti when mega herds gather in phenomenal numbers as far as the eye can see. 
Unique to Legendary Serengeti Camp, each group will have a dedicated safari guide &amp; vehicle, ensuring an intimate, action-packed safari experience.

#### Stay
The camp comprises 11 luxury canvas tents that are always pitched as a split camp.  This means that each half of the camp will be self-sufficient &amp; fully contained, with a private lounge &amp; dining space, offering an intimate camp atmosphere.
Each tent features an en-suite bathroom with a hot water bucket shower &amp; can accommodate up to 3 guests if there are families who are travelling with one child.
At each of the 2 main mess tents, you will find a lounge &amp; dining area, a well-stocked bar &amp; a central fire pit where pre-dinner drinks can be enjoyed.

#### Activities
The focus at Legendary Serengeti Camp is guaranteeing that each guest/party receives a private safari vehicle &amp; guide, ensuring an exclusive &amp; authentic safari experience.
Activities include open 4x4 game drives, guided bush walks in the Maswa Game Reserve as well as day trips to Ndutu when staying in the south.  In the north, optional hot air balloon safaris can also be added to your itinerary.
