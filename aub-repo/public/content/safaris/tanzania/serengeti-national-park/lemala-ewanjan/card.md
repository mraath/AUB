#### Experience
Lemala Ewanjan, a secluded tented camp set within the game-rich Seronera Valley in the Central Serengeti, provides awe-inspiring views over the plains.
The area is famed for its exceptional year-round game viewing due to its abundance of water in the many rivers, as well as for its large populations of resident big cats.
Lemala Ewanjan is built right at the end of a blind valley, so guests can enjoy uninterrupted views over the Serengetiâ€™s vast plains with teeming wildlife &amp; scenic landscapes.

#### Stay
The camp comprises 12 luxury tents, of which 7 are standard, 3 are quadruple, &amp; 2 are two-bedroom tents.  All tents are equipped with en-suite facilities.
The 7 luxury tents sleep 2 guests &amp; feature outdoor decks with beautiful views.  The 3 quadruple tents are identical to the standard tents, with the only exception that it can sleep 4 guests in 2 king-size beds.
The 2-bedroom tents are located on either side of a shared lounge to which one can enjoy sundowners or morning coffee.  These tents sleep a maximum of 6 people.
The mess tent with its separate bar, sitting &amp; dining areas is beautifully decorated with leather sofas, rugs &amp; chests.  Outside, you will find a crackling campfire - the perfect place to relax with a sunset cocktail while sharing interesting safari stories.
