### Singita Mara River Tented Camp

#### Experience
The name Singita is synonymous with world-class safaris &amp; their Mara River Tented Camp is no different.  
As the name suggests, Singita Mara River is set on the banks of the crocodile-infested Mara River in the northern Serengeti – the stage to the world’s most dramatic wildlife show:  The Great Wildebeest Migration.
Between July &amp; September, guests can witness how millions of wildebeest, zebra &amp; gazelle bravely cross the Mara River in search of greener pastures.
Migration season aside, the Serengeti is also home to an abundance of wildlife &amp; therefore offers spectacular year-round wildlife encounters.

#### Stay
Singita Mara River Tented Camp boasts 4 one-bedroom tents &amp; 2 family tents.
Each river-facing one-bedroom tent features an en-suite bathroom with an indoor &amp; outdoor shower &amp; private viewing deck.
The river-facing family tents each consist of 2 tents that share a deck area &amp; outdoor bathtub.  They can each sleep 2 adults &amp; 2 children.
The communal mess tent at Singita Mara River includes a lounge, dining area, café-style bar, spa &amp; an inviting deck with a swimming pool.
