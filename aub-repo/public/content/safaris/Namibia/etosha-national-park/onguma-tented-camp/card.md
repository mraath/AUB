In the local Herero language, Onguma means, “the place you don’t want to leave.”  
Living up to its name, accommodation at Onguma Tented Camp consists of 7 luxury tents, all designed to reflect earthy elegance.  
The camp is small &amp; intimate, providing an exclusive safari experience in a remote setting.  Romantics at heart will love the ‘under canvas’ feeling Onguma Tented Camp has to offer.

#### Activities

Lazy afternoons are spent relaxing on the sofas in the lounge, watching passing wildlife.
