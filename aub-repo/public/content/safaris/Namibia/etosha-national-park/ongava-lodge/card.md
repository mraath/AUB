### Ongava Lodge

#### Experience
Ongava Lodge is built on a small hill in the Ongava Game Reserve against the southern boundary of the world-renowned Etosha National Park in Namibia.
Offering splendid views over an active waterhole, guests can enjoy a host of thirsty wildlife from the main viewing deck.

#### Stay
Ongava Lodge consists of 13 chalets &amp; 1 family suite - all built out of brick, rock &amp; thatch to blend into the natural environment.  
Each chalet has an en-suite bathroom with a shower as well as air-conditioning &amp; overhead fans.  The rooms have glass-fronted doors leading out onto a private verandah overlooking the plains.
Impressive waterhole views can be enjoyed from the comfort of the lodge’s main lounge, bar &amp; dining areas.  Dinners are either served in the main dining room under thatch or on the outdoor deck under the stars.

#### Activities
Ongava Lodge provides a variety of exhilarating safari activities, some of which include day &amp; night drives, visiting hides that overlook waterholes &amp; guided walking safaris with experienced guides.
