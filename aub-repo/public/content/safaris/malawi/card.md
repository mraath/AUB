# Malawi
## SAFARIS
### Malawi

#### Experience
Lake Malawi is one of the world’s largest freshwater lakes & home to the largest number of fish species in the world, making it an ideal destination for water sport enthusiasts. These crystal-clear waters offer guests the opportunity to enjoy exciting water-based activities such as kayaking, diving, snorkelling, sailing & fishing.
Visitors can easily combine a ‘beach-style’ holiday at Lake Malawi with an off-the-beaten-track safari experience at Majete Wildlife Reserve or Liwonde National Park.
Majete is Malawi’s premier wildlife destination, offering guests the opportunity to tick off the Big 5 – lion, leopard, elephant buffalo & rhino - from their bucket list, while Liwonde is the perfect place to enjoy thrilling boating safaris on the beautiful Shire River.
Malawians describe themselves as ‘the friendliest people in Africa,’ & rightly so. Visitors will not only be greeted by warm smiles but will receive excellent service throughout their stay.
Malawi combines well with a Kruger safari or an Indian Ocean island holiday.

#### Stay
The country is wonderfully untouched by mass tourism, so most accommodations are small & intimate, offering sufficient comfort & spectacular scenery.
These include beautiful lakeside chalets, romantic safari hideaways & family-friendly lodges – each built to maximize the views & natural surroundings.

#### When to travel
The best time to visit Malawi is during the dry winter months, from May to October, when days are warm & sunny. During this time, guests can experience great beach weather as well as excellent wildlife viewing, including the Big 5. The hot, summer rainfall season is from November to April.
So, plan your Malawi vacation during the best time to visit Malawi, & enjoy its natural beauty, welcoming climate, warm people, & incredible wildlife.
