### Lake Malawi

#### Experience
When you stare out over the palm-fringed sandy beach with crystal-clear water, it is easy to think you are on an oceanic tropical island rather than the shores of Lake Malawi – one of the world’s largest freshwater lakes.
Covering 30,000 square km &amp taking up a large slice of Malawi, this freshwater body is home to the largest number of fish species in the world, making this an ideal destination for water sport enthusiasts.
Here, in what people call ‘the friendliest country in Africa,’ guests can enjoy freshwater snorkelling, scuba diving, kayaking, sailing &amp fishing.
Accommodation is mostly found around the lake’s southern &amp central regions, but even in the more visited areas, the lake remains wonderfully untouched by mass tourism. Beautiful lakeside chalets range from family-friendly beach resorts to romantic island lodges.
Lake Malawi is an ideal choice for guests who are looking for an off-the-beaten-track beach-style holiday where beautiful scenery, adventure activities &amp friendly service are of utmost importance.

#### Activities
Lake Malawi activities are mostly water-based. It has one of the most diverse ecosystems in the world with over 500 species of Cichlids. It is because of this abundant aquatic life, that Lake Malawi has some of the most diverse dive sites in the world.
Other popular activities include snorkelling, kayaking, sailing, boating &amp fishing.

#### When to travel
The best time to visit Lake Malawi is during the drier winter months, between May to late October when days are warm &amp sunny – great for beach weather!
The hot summer rains fall between November to April.
