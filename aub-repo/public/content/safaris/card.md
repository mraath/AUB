# SAFARIS
## Unwind With Us
### SAFARIS

Perhaps everyone on Planet Earth has dreamed of going on safari to Africa! The word safari means “journey” & enjoying a luxury African safari is a unique journey to say the least.
Getting up close & personal with some of the world’s most impressive & endangered animals, sleeping in luxury tents at the best safari lodges & learning more about the fascinating African culture is what luxury safari holidays are all about.
Not that you need further convincing, here are our top 6 reasons why you should book a luxury safari adventure today.
#### A BUCKET LIST EXPERIENCE
Luxury African safaris offer you a unique combination of opulence, wildlife & adventure in a single experience, unmatched anywhere else in the world.
#### SEE WILDLIFE UP CLOSE
Seeing the real Africa from an open 4x4 vehicle, boat or canoe is simply magical. Encountering the Big 5 – lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo & rhino – & spotting extraordinary bird species in their natural habitat, is something you will never forget.
#### ESCAPE TO NATURE
Most of our lives today are filled with long hours at the office & too much screen time! Visiting Africa allows us to slow down, kick off our shoes & escape to a world where we can only hear birds chirping.
#### PLENTY OF ACTIVITIES
Kids & adults around the world have one thing in common – we love to have fun while on holiday! You can be sure of this...A safari adventure will keep everyone entertained. (But if you are hoping to do as little as possible – you are most welcome to do so.)
#### BEAUTIFUL SUNSETS
What is more magical than rounding off your afternoon with a popular safari ritual: sundowner drinks in the bush? You’re invited to watch the sun set while sipping on your drink of choice, surrounded by nature at the best safari lodges in Africa.
#### A PHOTOGRAPHER’S DREAM
Professional photographers, & the ‘Average Joe’ who loves taking pictures, will all fall in love with Africa. Capture impressive animals, golden sunsets or interesting people & make memories that will last forever.
