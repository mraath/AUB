## Kibale Forest National Park
### Ndali Lodge

#### Experience
Ndali Lodge is perched on the edge of an extinct volcano, which over centuries has been filled with water to become the vast Lake Nyinambuga in the Bunyaruguru Crater Field in Uganda.
This rustic &amp; intimate lodge prides itself on its relaxed &amp; friendly atmosphere, ensuring that its guests feel right at home throughout their stay.  The staff are locals who come from nearby villages &amp; have been professionally trained to ensure excellent service.

#### Stay
Ndali Lodge has 8 individual cottages, all of which offer spectacular views of the Rwenzori
Mountains &amp; Queen Elizabeth National Park.
The solar-energy cottages are built of local stone &amp; thatch &amp; therefore blend in with the natural environment.  Each cottage is large enough to accommodate a family &amp; is equipped with an en-suite bathroom &amp; private veranda.
There is also a honeymoon cottage that is slightly larger &amp; comes complete with bathtub &amp; shower.
The lodgeâ€™s communal area includes a lounge, dining room &amp; swimming pool with endless views of the beautiful lake.

#### Activities
Ndali provides local guides for guided walks around the thousand-acre farm &amp; to the Mahoma
Waterfall, with the opportunity to spot primates, birds &amp; butterflies along the way. Guests can also go on exciting kayak excursions on the lake.
