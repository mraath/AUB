#### Experience
Overlooking the breathtaking Lake Kyaninga lies one of Uganda’s most luxurious resorts outside the capital – Kyaninga Lodge.  
This ideal lake location offers spectacular views &amp; since it is nearby the town of Fort Portal, it has easy access to amazing hiking trails with views of the Great Rift Valley &amp; Rwenzori Mountains.

#### Stay
Kyaninga Lodge has 9 cottages (including 2 family cottages) built on platforms &amp; set apart to offer privacy &amp; tranquillity.  The cottages can be reached via raised wooden walkways.  
Each spacious cottage features an en-suite bathroom, claw-footed free-standing bath &amp; glass-walled shower.  The indoor sitting area at each cottage leads out to a private deck where one can enjoy beautiful views over the lake &amp; mountains.
The central area at Kyaninga Lodge comprises a restaurant serving delicious meals, a sparkling swimming pool, a cocktail bar as well as a wellness spa where relaxing post-trek massages can be enjoyed.

#### Activities
Hiking is a popular activity at Kyaninga.  Walks to the crater rim, forest, nearby villages &amp; Great Rift Valley can be arranged.
Only 60 minutes away, is Kibale National Park – an area that covers about 795 sq km &amp; is acknowledged to have the highest density of chimpanzees in the world.  Chimpanzee trekking is also one of our favourites!
Day trips to Queen Elizabeth National Park (2 hours away) can also be arranged.  This area is 95 species of mammals &amp; over 500 species of birds!  A boat trip up the Kazinga Channel is a must!
