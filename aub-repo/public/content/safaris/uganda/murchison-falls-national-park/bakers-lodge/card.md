#### Experience
Baker’s Lodge enjoys a beautiful location on the southern bank of the mighty Nile River in Murchison National Park – Uganda’s largest national park, &amp; together with adjoining wildlife reserves forms a vast wilderness covering 5,000 square km.
The lodge is named after the English explorer, Samuel Baker – the first European to view the falls &amp; name it.
The Murchison National Park is home to a wide variety of wildlife, forest primates &amp; 450 bird species.  The Nile River – the longest river in the world – flows on its 6,500 km journey from Lake Victoria to Egypt &amp; the Mediterranean Sea.
The highlight for guests visiting the park is viewing the awe-inspiring 40-metre high Murchison Falls where the Nile is forced through an 8-metre gap in the Rift Valley escarpment.

#### Stay
Baker’s Lodge has 10 well-spaced thatched safari suites, providing guests with the utmost privacy.  Each suite is raised on wooden pillars with individual decks allowing for breathtaking views of the river.
Each safari suite is fitted with solar lighting, bespoke wooden furniture &amp; an open-plan en-suite bathroom.  Some suites also feature a bathtub with a view.
Resident hippos are frequently see wallowing in the shallows of the pod just a few steps from the rooms.
The central area of the lodge comprises a bar, dining room, restaurant &amp; swimming pool where lazy days can be spent.
