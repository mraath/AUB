The capital of Uganda – Kampala, is the country’s commercial, political &amp logistical hub, but also one of East Africa’s most friendly &amp relaxed cities.
A mere 60-minute drive away, you will find the laid-back Entebbe – a modern &amp picturesque city that is home to the country’s international airport as well as Africa’s largest lake, the beautiful Lake Victoria.
Both Kampala &amp Entebbe are the ideal pitstop destinations for a gorilla or chimp trekking safari to Uganda, making it convenient for travelers seeking an all-encompassing Kampala travel experience.

There are also a variety of restaurants, bars &amp nightly outdoor events including drumming &amp comedy nights, providing a vibrant cultural experience.
Kampala is also home to the UNESCO listed Kasubi Tombs – the burial site for the kings &amp the royal family of the Buganda kingdom. Kampala is dotted with colourful crafts markets – including the popular Crafts Village – that sells vibrant crafts ranging from prints, baskets, paintings, pottery, jewellery &amp more, making it an ideal destination to explore National Cultural Centre events in Uganda.
