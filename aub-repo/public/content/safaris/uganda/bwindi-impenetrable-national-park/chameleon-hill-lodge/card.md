# Chameleon Hill Lodge
## Bwindi Impenetrable National Park
### Chameleon Hill Lodge

#### Experience
Chameleon Hill Lodge enjoys a spectacular location overlooking an unspoilt Rift Valley lake framed by the rugged Virunga Volcanoes.  
Lying between the nearby Bwindi Forest &amp; Mgahinga Park - Uganda’s prime gorilla trekking destinations – Chameleon Hill Lodge offers not only the chance to track mountain gorillas, but also to enjoy hiking &amp; mountain biking as well as exhilarating boat trips &amp; cultural interactions.
The bold, vibrant design of the lodge gives a feeling of rustic charm &amp; creates a warm family-friendly atmosphere.

#### Stay
Chameleon Hill Lodge has 10 suites, each enjoying spectacular views over Lake Mutanda with its scattered islands.
Each suite features an en-suite bathroom &amp; private terrace where relaxing afternoons can be spent after a gorilla trek expedition.
The main lodge area includes a lounge, bar &amp; spa where relaxing massages can be enjoyed.  The Chameleon Hill Kitchen serves beautiful organic &amp; wholesome dishes.

#### Activities
A long list of activities is on the menu at Chameleon Hill Lodge.  
The highlight is, of course, the gorilla trek.  Chameleon Hill also offers additional research-based treks that allow guests more time with the gorillas (4 hours instead of 1), &amp; with fewer visitors.  
Guests can also go on exciting nature walks in search of the rare golden monkey, go bird watching on the lake or hit a mountain bike trail.  
Hikes to extinct volcanoes &amp; local village visits are also popular options.  The Batwa people will teach you how to weave a traditional basket or carve a mask.
