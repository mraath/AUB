#### Experience
Clouds Mountain Gorilla Lodge in Uganda has easy access to at least 6 gorilla families who live in the nearby Bwindi Impenetrable Park – a bucket-list activity on everyone’s list!
Cloud’s goal is to support long-term protection of the gorillas &amp; originated as a conservation project between the Nkuringo community, the African Wildlife Foundation &amp; the Uganda Safari Company.  
The views from the lodge are truly breathtaking – from the large windows guests will have uninterrupted views over the tranquil forest &amp; Virunga volcanoes.

#### Stay
There are 6 suites &amp; 2 family suites at Clouds Mountain Gorilla Lodge, each with a spacious &amp; en-suite bathroom &amp; walk-in shower.  
The rooms are comfortable &amp; have fireplaces for cooler winter evenings.  The family suites at Clouds can sleep 2 adults &amp; 2 children.
The lodge has a bar with friendly staff, which includes personal butlers.

#### Activities
In addition to seeing the endangered mountain gorillas, there are plenty of activities on the list at Clouds.  
These include bird watching hikes with guides into Bwindi, village visits to the Batwa community in the Buniga Forest or enjoying a relaxing post-trek massage in the Okuruhuuka Spa.
Private dinners in an awe-inspiring location can also be arranged.  
During the day, under 15’s who are not permitted to go gorilla trekking can be entertained by community members with African dancing &amp; drumming lessons, art projects, treasure hunts &amp; interactive games with village children.
