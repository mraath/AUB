# We Say
## BLOG
### We Say

Everyone wants to have a voice. In the travel world, it is important to listen to voices that are “tried & tested.”  Normally, we love to pay attention to people when we feel a connection to them (personal), when we trust them (reliable) & when we can learn something from them. (informative)

This is our promise to you when reading this blog!

You will find our voice seeping through these pages…We invite you to listen as we share our personal travel memories, reliable travel tips & first-hand knowledge of what we have learned during our travels in Africa.

Travel with us as we explore some of our favourite holiday moments:  From sunny safaris & extraordinary island holidays to family getaways & city vacations.

We will share travel tips of ‘what to do’ & ‘what not to do’ when traveling through Africa, interesting facts about the wildlife we have spotted & a tried & tested luggage checklist – our helpful aid for all luxury safari travellers.

As you scroll through these pages, you will hear our voice.

Hopefully it inspires you.  To dream.  To learn.  To travel.
