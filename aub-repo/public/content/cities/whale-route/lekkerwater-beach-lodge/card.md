### Lekkerwater Beach Lodge

#### Experience
Set in a beautiful corner of the De Hoop Nature Reserve, Lekkerwater Beach Lodge offers guests a modern, eco-friendly stay in a spectacular ocean-front location.
The area is renowned for its excellent land-based whale watching, but against the backdrop of flower-filled fynbos vegetation &amp; distant purple mountains, De Hoop is also home to other animals like baboons, ostriches &amp; eland as well as dolphins, tortoises &amp; sea birds.
Easily reached via self-drive, Lekkerwater (translated as ‘the place of good water’), lies less than a 4-hour drive from Cape Town or the Winelands, which makes this an ideal stop on a Cape Town to Garden Route self-drive itinerary.
The lodge is a wonderful fit for all types of travellers – from couples, honeymooners &amp; families with young children to wildlife enthusiasts, bird watchers &amp; nature photographers.

#### Stay
Lekkerwater Beach Lodge offers an intimate &amp; off-the-beaten-track beachfront experience.  There are only 7 suites, scattered along 6km of pristine white-sand beaches, one of which is a family unit.
Each suite boasts a private deck, offering uninterrupted views of the azure Indian Ocean &amp; each year between July &amp; November, guests may have the opportunity to witness whales breach in the bay as they migrate from Antarctica.
The beautiful floor-to-ceiling glass windows &amp; wood-burning fireplaces complete each suite, along with open-plan en-suite showers offering a private peek at the ocean.  
The family suite consists of 2 bedrooms &amp; a shared bathroom with an open-plan shower.  Kids have their own private loft – a magical little haven for young travellers.
At the main lodge, you will find a comfortable lounge with a fireplace, a dining room &amp; a large deck with a swimming pool.

#### Activities
Lekkerwater activities include whale watching, guided hikes to tidal rock pools &amp; caves, bird watching, swimming &amp; photography.  Guests can also enjoy history talks or dine al fresco under the stars.
