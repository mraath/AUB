### Ocean Eleven Guest House

#### Experience
Ocean Eleven Guest House is located within the heart of whale-watching country on a fynbos-covered, ocean-facing cliff in Hermanus â€“ one of the most sought-after locations along the Whale Route.  
From this elegant beach house, exceptional views across Walker Bay can be enjoyed.  
Right on your doorstep, you will find interesting &amp; exciting walking paths overlooking the ocean, so Ocean Eleven guests can walk for miles on end while taking in the breathtaking beauty of this scenic seaside town.
Hermanus is the heart of the Whale Route &amp; boasts the best land-based whale watching in the world between July &amp; November.  
Guests can spot these amazing creatures right in front of the guest house as tall windows &amp; large glass doors open onto a breakfast deck with gorgeous ocean views.

#### Stay
Ocean Eleven boasts 10 en-suite rooms, each with beautiful views of Walker Bay.  Three of these are standard rooms, 5 are deluxe rooms &amp; 2 are suites.
Some of the rooms have private balconies or doors that open onto the garden.  There are also 2 loft-style suites that are incredibly spacious, both featuring full en-suite bathrooms &amp; private balconies with panoramic views of Walker Bay.
The main area comprises an indoor dining area, lounge, outdoor terrace with a swimming pool where lazy afternoons can be spent reading a book or cooling off with a cocktail in hand.

#### Activities
Guests visiting between July &amp; November do not even have to take a boat trip out to sea to enjoy good whale watching.  They can simply take a gentle stroll along the walking paths next to the guest house &amp; watch these gentle giants in action.
