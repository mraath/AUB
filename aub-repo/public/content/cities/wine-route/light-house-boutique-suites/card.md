Off -the-beaten-track, The Light House Boutique Suites is, without a doubt, the Winelands’ best-kept secret.   The beautiful Paarl valley is home to breathtaking views, superb food &amp; wine, rich history &amp; interesting shops.

#### Stay

This was personally navigated down to the last detail with bespoke furniture, soft furnishings, luxurious fabrics, Egyptian cotton bed linen &amp; objet d’art.
The main area consists of an elegant dining room, comfortable lounge area, well-stocked library, outside terrace overlooking the garden &amp; a large swimming pool.

#### Activities
At The Light House, there are plenty of activities to be enjoyed.  Visit one of the nearby wine farms &amp; make a stop at the beautiful Franschhoek valley or the charming town of Stellenbosch.
In Paarl, Oak lined streets entice one to venture into captivating ‘discoveries’ of wines, food, olive growers, master chocolatiers, cheesemakers, crafts, glass blowers &amp; various cultural highlights.
Dining at The Light House is a fabulous affair.  Enjoy a cocktail or sundowner on the outside terrace before embarking on a culinary journey of note.
