### Grand Dedale Country House

#### Experience
The scenic &amp; secluded Grand Dedale Country House is set along a dirt road at the foot of the Bainskloof Pass on Doolhof, a working wine estate close to the Winelands town of Wellington.
This elegant retreat is surrounded by mountains &amp; forests, offering guests a rural elegance a mere hour’s drive from the vibrant city of Cape Town.
Here, guests are treated like royalty – from opulent suites &amp; relaxing spa treatments to high tea buffets &amp; 4-course dinners prepared with locally sourced ingredients.  Romantic picnic basket lunches can also be arranged for guests wishing to get closer to nature, or perhaps visit one of the mountain viewpoints.
Grand Dedale will connect you with nature.  A wide selection of outdoor activities is available, including hiking, biking &amp; fishing as well as horse riding.

#### Stay
Guests will have their pick between 6 individually styled rooms &amp; a double volume honeymoon cottage.
The rooms are located within the main manor house while the beautifully restored 1707 cottage stands quietly amid the paddocks &amp; gardens, ensuring guests have the utmost privacy.
Communal areas at Grand Dedale include a lounge &amp; dining space, a cosy well-stocked library &amp; a large deck with swimming pool &amp; sun loungers.  There is also a wellness spa &amp; gym.

#### Activities
Grand Dedale is truly a slice of paradise &amp; offers a range of exciting nature activities.
On-site, guests can enjoy hiking, mountain biking, bird watching &amp; gourmet picnics as well as horse riding, relaxing spa treatments &amp; sumptuous high teas.
