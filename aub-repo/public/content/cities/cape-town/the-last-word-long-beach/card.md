### The Last Word Long Beach

#### Experience
With an unbeatable location on a long stretch of white, sandy beach in the picturesque seaside village of Kommetjie, The Last Word Long Beach will quite literally take your breath away.
Not only will you see a spectacularly beautiful beach right on your doorstep, but guests can walk straight from their elegant suite onto the unspoilt dunes of Long Beach.
This small &amp; intimate luxury boutique hotel is available on an individual daily-room basis or as an entire villa to share with your family or friends.
Breathtaking views of Hout Bay &amp; Table Mountain are the cherry on top – along with a very convenient in-house chauffeur service.  
The area will provide guests with an off-the-beaten-track experience away from the hustle &amp; bustle, yet only a 40-minute drive away from Cape Town - South Africa’s most beautiful city.

#### Stay
With only 6 stylish suites, The Last Word Long Beach provides only the best in barefoot beach luxury.  Accommodation comprises 2 elegant suites that are located upstairs as well as 1 junior suite &amp; 3 superior double suites downstairs.
From the comfort of each suite, guests can enjoy endless views of the Atlantic Ocean ahead and the Chapman's Peak mountains beyond.
The elegant suites include a separate lounge area &amp; a private ocean-facing balcony.  On the lower level, you will find a junior suite with a separate lounge area &amp; a separate bath &amp; shower.  Each of the superior double suites has a private patio &amp; separate bath &amp; shower.
Facilities at The Last Word Long Beach include a swimming pool, bar, library &amp; nearby gym.
