Nestled between the Indian & Atlantic Oceans with iconic Table Mountain as backdrop, lies one of the world’s most vibrant &amp; breathtaking cities. And with so much to see and do in Cape Town, we guarantee a holiday you won’t forget!
Cape Town is a multi-faceted destination that deserves to be explored by everyone – from romantics & honeymooners who will love the luxurious accommodation &amp; idyllic views to adventure lovers &amp; families looking for an action-packed holiday.
Not only is this beautiful city home to Table Mountain - one of the 7 Natural Wonders of the World, but also boasts spectacular white, sandy beaches, luxurious accommodation &amp; world-class shopping.
As South Africa’s gourmet capital, visitors will be blown away by Cape Town’s wide selection of award-winning restaurants &amp; exquisite wines (easily one of our top Cape Town Travel Tips - experience the food!).
This cosmopolitan city is so easy to combine with other amazing destinations. A short drive away you will find the scenic Wine Route where you can sample some of South Africa’s best wines as well as the Whale Route that offers the best land-based whale watching in the world.
The Garden Route with its breathtaking scenery &amp; interesting coastal towns should also be added to a longer Cape Town stay.

#### Activities
If there were ever a city that offers a long list of cultural experiences and other activities, Cape Town takes the prize! Some of these include visits to Table Mountain, Cape Point, Boulders Beach penguin colony, the colorful Bo-Kaap, Kirstenbosch Gardens & the vibrant V&amp;A Waterfront with its boutique shops &amp; restaurants.
Beach lovers should also make a stop at Clifton with its white, sandy beaches or the trendy Camps Bay with its cocktail bars &amp; sidewalk cafes. Other exciting activities include helicopter flights, cooking courses, township tours &amp; historical boat cruises to Robben Island.

#### When to travel
Cape Town enjoys a temperate climate with warm, dry conditions from October to April – the best time to travel. Between December & February, temperatures peak which is the most popular time for a beach holiday.
