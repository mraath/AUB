## CITIES
### Johannesburg

#### Experience
Johannesburg is one of the world’s youngest major cities &amp; the ideal stop-over safari destination.
Also known as Joburg, Jozi &amp; City of Gold, this bustling city has become the regional hub for flights from around the globe, making OR Tambo International Airport the biggest &amp; busiest airport in Africa.
Excellent weather can be enjoyed throughout the year with warm, wind-free days in summer &amp; crisp, clear days in winter.
When it comes to shopping, Johannesburg has it all. Guests can enjoy world-class shopping at one of the plethora of malls scattered in every corner of the city or shop local at one of Joburg’s neighbourhood markets.
The city is best explored with a private guide who knows all the hot spots of Jozi so that guests can sit back &amp; relax – without having to navigate the busy streets on their own.

#### Activities
Activities in Johannesburg are ample.
One of the best things to do in Johannesburg is a private guided excursion that includes Soweto township visits, historical tours to the Apartheid Museum as well as art expeditions to Joburg’s creative districts – Newtown, Maboneng &amp; Downtown.
Of course, guests can shop to their hearts’ content or enjoy relaxing treatments at one of Johannesburg’s many wellness spas.
There are also a variety of day tours available for guests who would like to explore cultural sites in Johannesburg’s surrounding areas. These include excursions to Sun City, Lesedi Cultural Village or the game-rich Pilanesberg National Park.
