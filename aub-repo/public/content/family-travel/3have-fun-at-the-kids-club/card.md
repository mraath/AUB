### 3Have Fun At The Kids Club

HAVE FUN AT THE KIDS CLUB
Holidays are supposed to be fun!  But often ‘fun for Mum &amp; Dad’, doesn’t necessarily mean ‘fun for the kids!’ (&amp; vice versa) But when your family travels to Africa, we’ll make sure that ‘fun’ is indeed for the whole family.
One of the best ways to ensure that everyone is happy is to pick family-friendly lodges with Kids Clubs. That way, the little ones can play at their heart’s content, learn about Africa &amp; enjoy a variety of fun activities while Mum &amp; Dad enjoy an afternoon siesta.   
There are wonderful Kids Clubs throughout Africa, but we’ll share some of our favourites with you – so start packing &amp; get ready for oodles of family fun!
1. Mauritius
Yes, Mauritius is Number 1 on our list, because most resorts on this beautiful island boast fantastic Kids (&amp; Teens) Clubs that will keep your kids busy for days!  Mauritius resorts offer an impressive amount of age-appropriate land &amp; water activities – with dedicated adult supervision, of course.  So, Mum &amp; Dad can relax by the pool, enjoy water sports or take a siesta as kids craft &amp; play to their hearts’ content.
2. Madikwe Safari Lodge, Madikwe Game Reserve – South Africa
At Madikwe Safari Lodge, kids will learn how to survive in the bush with lessons on which trees’ branches make the best toothbrushes, how to find your way in the bush, make fire &amp; source water.  ‘Bug CSI’ will take the little ones on guided walks around camp to find different plants &amp; insects while spoor &amp; dung tracking are both great hits among young explorers.
3. Londolozi Varty Camp, Sabi Sand Reserve – South Africa
Londolozi stands out above the rest when it comes to a child’s tailored safari experience.  Recognising that each child is unique, an assessment is done upon arrival by a ranger &amp; qualified facilitator who then custom design a fun-filled safari itinerary for each child.  Private game drives mean that your family can come &amp; go, stop, touch, feel &amp; smell at your own pace.  Back at camp, kids will also enjoy archery, tree climbing, fishing, movie nights, pizza making, sling-shot competitions, water-based games, Masterchef cook-offs, arts &amp; crafts, &amp; photography lessons.
