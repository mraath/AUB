### 4Float In a Hot Air Balloon

FLOAT IN A HOT AIR BALLOON
Everyone around the world – regardless of your age, gender or ethnicity has probably dreamt about flying.  We’re not just talking about stepping onto an aeroplane, fastening your seatbelt &amp; flying across the ocean to another country…Of course, that is a given.  
We’re talking about floating in the sky &amp; experiencing life from a bird’s eye view.  This is the dream.  So why not dream big &amp; set off on a scenic hot air balloon safari?
Something magical happens when you observe the bush from a different vantage point.  The peaceful surroundings below you are filled with bright colours as the sun rises over the eastern horizon.  As the earth warms up, the wildlife starts to become active &amp; it is quite the thrill to spot animals as they move across the plains.  The balloon can fly relatively low over big herds (unlike helicopters &amp; small planes), making this one of the best ways to witness the Great Wildebeest Migration.
Floating in a hot air balloon is a photographer’s dream.  Nothing quite compares to capturing the stillness of the bush from the sky &amp; finding inspiration from nature.  Rest assured:   Africa has it all.  From Sosussvlei’s red sand dunes to the vast plains of the Serengeti &amp; Masai Mara – life in the sky has its rewards.  
When you touch down on solid earth again, scrumptious champagne breakfast awaits you, prepared &amp; served on the savannah – a wonderful ending to the perfect safari experience.  
Fly with us as we point out Africa’s most amazing hot air balloon safaris.
1. Serengeti National Park, Tanzania
A balloon ride over the Serengeti is one of the most iconic in all of Africa.  Known as one of the most famous national parks in the world, the Serengeti is not only home to the Great Wildebeest Migration but will also offer you plenty to see.  Keep an eye out for giraffe, elephant, buffalo &amp; impala while you soar through the sky.
2. Sossusvlei, Namibia
Surrounded by desert, mountains &amp; a landscape of acacia trees, Sossusvlei is one of Africa’s most scenic destinations.  As the sun rises over the desert, the colour of the sand dunes turns blood red – a welcomed surprise for photographers who are eager to take that perfect picture.  Visitors are drawn to this area for its sparse, yet beautiful landscape that is best viewed from the sky. 
3. Masai Mara, Kenya
The iconic Masai Mara is a magnet for travellers from around the globe &amp; known for its vast open plains - home to the Great Wildebeest Migration.  Soaring in a hot air balloon over these endless plains is often a highlight of a Masai Mara safari.  Spotting wildlife from the air as you glide above the trees is an experience you will never forget.    
4. Kafue National Park, Zambia
Kafue is one of Africa’s premier hot air balloon safari destinations, because of its remoteness &amp; abundance of wildlife.  Get excited, because if you visit Kafue, you will have an opportunity to spot animals like hippo, buffalo, puku &amp; red lechwe from the air.
5. Tarangire National Park, Tanzania
Known for its breathtaking landscape, Tarangire National Park is also home to large elephant herds – often visible from the air.  Balloon guests can also spot herds of zebra, running gazelles &amp; Verreaux Eagle Owls from the comfort of the basket.
