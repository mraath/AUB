#### Experience
Overlooking a turquoise lagoon on Belle Mare beach on Mauritiusâ€™ east coast, lies the family-friendly LUX Belle Mare.
The lagoon is a drawing card for water sport enthusiasts &amp; avid swimmers, while the long stretch of white, sandy beach in front of the resort is dotted with thatched umbrellas.
Unique to LUX Belle Mare, the Tea House offers nearly 90 different blends to sample &amp; the LUX Beer Academy affords tastings of Mari Kontan rum &amp; beer.
In the evenings, the beach is transformed into an open-air cinema while the buzzing sea-front hangout with an open-air terrace invites guests to dance the night away.

#### Stay
LUX Belle Mare features 121 stylish air-conditioned suites with thatched roofs, lush gardens &amp; a terrace or balcony offering breathtaking views of the Indian Ocean.
Thatched umbrellas are dotted along the white, sandy stretch of beach in front of the resort.
The massive swimming pool looks out over the azure lagoon where parents can relax while the children are entertained at the nearby Kids Corner.  LUX Belle Mare also has a bridal shop, a dedicated wedding photographer &amp; a wellness spa.
