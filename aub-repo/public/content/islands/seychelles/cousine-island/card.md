### Cousine Island

#### Experience
Have you ever dreamt of staying on a secluded, private island - surrounded by miles &amp; miles of warm, turquoise water &amp; lush, palm trees?  The lavish Cousine Island is not only an idyllic &amp; private tropical destination but also one that is dedicated to nature conservation.
Yes, the island might be small – around 30 hectares big – yet it is packed with wildlife.
Apart from seeing green turtles nest all year round, guests can also encounter Aldabra giant tortoises as well as 7 breeding species of sea birds.  Seasonal hawkbills can be seen between September &amp; April.
Offering a boutique experience, Cousine Island only sleeps a maximum of 12 adults &amp; 6 kids, which means that the island can also be booked on an exclusive-use basis.
Not only will guests be able to enjoy a variety of exciting water sports &amp; spa treatments, but kids will have fun building sandcastles, going on treasure hunts or doing fun science experiments.

#### Stay
Being the only resort on the entire island, accommodation remains small &amp; intimate.  There are only 4 luxury villas &amp; 1 presidential villa, all boasting infinity pools &amp; access to a gorgeous, sandy beach.
Cousine Island offers world-class facilities &amp; cuisine, providing only the best in barefoot luxury.  The Pavilion houses the fresh-water swimming pool, lounge &amp; library as well as a terrace where guests can enjoy spectacular views.   
There is also a dining area &amp; bar as well as an open-plan kitchen that allows guests to interact with the chef while he prepares meals from the freshest local ingredients.

#### Activities
The concierge will assist guests in planning their activities.  There are many options to choose from, including helicopter sightseeing, afternoon boat cruises, champagne picnics on a deserted beach &amp; diving or snorkelling.
Other exciting options are kayaking, stand-up paddleboarding, volleyball, nature walks, Creole cooking lessons, spa treatments &amp; caving.  Kids can go on treasure hunts, build sandcastles or do fun science experiments.
