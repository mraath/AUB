## ISLANDS
### Seychelles

#### Experience
This beautiful island republic in the western Indian Ocean boasts 115 islands with lush tropical vegetation, postcard-perfect beaches, &amp; a wide variety of marine life.
Seychelles, the combined name for all these islands, remains one of the world’s most beautiful &amp; secluded beach destinations, offering visitors only the best in barefoot luxury. 
Here, honeymooners &amp; romantics can enjoy elegant living in award-winning resorts or super stylish villas &amp; experience world-class diving &amp; snorkelling, against a backdrop of sugar-white sand &amp; crystal-clear waters.
Even though the Seychelles archipelago is made up of more than a hundred islands, the vast majority of them are completely uninhabited. Most Seychellois live on one of the 3 biggest islands - Mahe, La Digue &amp; Praslin - all of which are home to luxurious resorts, stylish villas &amp; pristine beaches.
There are also a handful of private islands that are ideal for discerning travellers who are looking for a tranquil escape in unsurpassed luxury. The best beaches in Seychelles make it a romantic island destination where couples can enjoy private dinners, sunset cocktails &amp; relaxing spa treatments – the perfect ending to an African holiday.

#### Stay
Luxurious resorts &amp; stylish villas are scattered throughout the Seychelles, offering guests the opportunity to live out their tropical island fantasy – in world-class luxury.
The resorts &amp; villas are built on the beach, offering spectacular views over the Indian Ocean &amp; white, powdery beaches. Some villas offer private pools, outdoor showers &amp; sundecks with hammocks – the ideal place to relax while watching the sun set over the picture-perfect beaches of Seychelles.

#### When to travel
Lying just below the equator, the islands of the Seychelles have warm, beach-weather year-round. The hottest months are December to April &amp; the wettest are January &amp; February – although it generally rains in short tropical downpours, after which the sun comes out again.
Diving is excellent year-round, but for crystal-clear conditions &amp; visibility up to 30 meters – travel between April &amp; May or October &amp; November. 
Between May &amp; October, some beaches on the southern coasts of Mahe &amp; Praslin are affected by seasonal trade winds that wash up seaweed onto the beaches – although a seaweed-free beach is never far away. (complimentary shuttles)
