#### Experience
Four Seasons Desroches Island is set on a private island in the Seychelles.  It is not surprising that this slice of paradise is considered one of the most pristine &amp; untouched islands in the world.  
Desroches is fortunate in that it enjoys a healthy climate year-round, along with miles of unspoilt beaches &amp; picturesque scenery.  
A wonderful choice for discerning families, Four Seasons Desroches’s villas have private pools &amp; direct beach access, making it especially convenient for parents travelling with young children.  
The resort offers world-class diving &amp; snorkelling, along with a range of exciting water sports &amp; land-based activities.

A variety of luxurious suites &amp; villas are scattered throughout the island.  These suites &amp; villas consist of ocean view pool villas, beach pool villas, sunset view pool villas as well as two-, three, five- &amp; seven-bedroom presidential villas.
The ocean view pool villas are located close to the recreational facilities, boasting a private garden, pool &amp; beautiful sea views.  Tucked away under palm trees, the beach pool villas have partial sea views &amp; also feature private pools as well as indoor &amp; outdoor showers.
Each sunset view pool villa offers glorious ocean views from the upper balcony &amp; features a lounge &amp; pool cabana. There are also a variety of presidential villas, each beautifully designed to accommodate families or friends travelling in style.
