### Enchanted Island Resort

#### Experience
As the name suggests, Enchanted Island Resort is located on a captivating 5-acre private island, just a short boat ride from Mahe Island in the Seychelles.
Here, guests can escape the hustle &amp; bustle of everyday life &amp; embrace a luxurious island experience where private plunge pools &amp; outdoor showers are just as important as beautiful, white sandy beaches &amp; crystal-clear waters.
Offering a boutique island experience, Enchanted Island Resort is a great pick for honeymooners or romantics looking for an intimate &amp; secluded stay.
Romantic island activities include kayaking together to a nearby island or enjoying couple’s massages in the spa’s massage pavilion.

#### Stay
Inspired by Creole-Seychellois heritage, the 10 one-bedroom private pool villas are scattered along the beach.
Each villa features an open-air bathroom &amp; a spacious indoor area with floor-to-ceiling windows that open to an outdoor deck with an infinity pool.  
At the main lodge area, you will find an inviting restaurant &amp; bar overlooking the swimming pool &amp; deck area.  Walkways connect each villa to the beaches &amp; other lodge facilities.  
At the centre of the island, the spa is perched on a hill offering tranquil views over the ocean.  Here, guests can either opt for the private therapy room or enjoy the couples’ treatment room with a  private steam room, outdoor bathtub &amp; viewing deck.
Other facilities include a gym, relaxation pavilion &amp; a helipad situated on the jetty.
