### Time + Tide Miavana

#### Experience
Off the northeast coast of Madagascar, on Nosy Ankao – the largest of 5 pristine islands that form a protected archipelago – you will find Time + Tide Miavana.
Forming part of a 37,000-hectare protected marine area that is only accessible by helicopter, Miavana offers jaw-dropping views over the endless Indian Ocean &amp; direct access to the beach from each villa.
Between December &amp; February, guests can watch turtles lay eggs &amp; until April, the little hatchlings make their way across the beach to reach the ocean safely.  
Guests who visit between June &amp; August will have the rare chance to witness terns nest on a nearby deserted island – the biggest nesting site in the Indian Ocean.  Each year, between 40,000 &amp; 90,000 seabirds nest here.

#### Stay
Dotted along the pristine beach, Time + Tide Miavana’s 14 villas boast awe-inspiring views of the endless Indian Ocean.
Each one, two &amp; three-bedroom villa offer ample space (minimum 450 square meters), a private pool overlooking the ocean, a comfortable lounge, butler service &amp; an additional bathroom &amp; study which can be converted into a children’s room.
Miavana’s main beach piazza features an infinity pool &amp; rooftop bar, boasting one of the most amazing views in the world.  Their comfortable lounge is the perfect place to unwind with a drink &amp; the wine cellar offers an eclectic mix of the finest local and international wines.

#### Activities
A wide range of exciting island activities is available at Miavana.  
These include snorkelling, scuba diving, kayaking, kite surfing &amp; fishing as well as boat trips to see dolphins, manta rays &amp; whales.
