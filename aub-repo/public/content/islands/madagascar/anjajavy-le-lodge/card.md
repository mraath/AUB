## Madagascar
### Anjajavy le Lodge

#### Experience
Utterly remote &amp; only accessible by air, you will find the luxurious Anjajavy le Lodge – one of Madagascar’s best-kept secrets.
On this untouched north-western edge of Madagascar, this Relais &amp; Chateaux property sits in its own 1,030-hectare nature reserve – home to over 1,800 species of flora &amp; a variety of exotic animals like the brown lemur &amp; rare Madagascar fish eagle.
There are 12 private beaches in this remote &amp; untouched area of Madagascar that are shared with only a handful of guests that Anjajavy accommodates.
Anjajavy le Lodge is the perfect place to explore idyllic beaches &amp; small coves, relax by the pool or enjoy private boat trips or intimate al fresco dining.

#### Stay
The lodge boasts 24 luxury ocean-facing villas that are scattered among lush gardens &amp; only a few steps away from private sandy beaches with azure water.
The ground floor of each air-conditioned villa houses an en-suite master bedroom &amp; features a lounge &amp; large deck looking out onto the ocean.  On the mezzanine floor is a second bedroom with 2 single beds as well as a sea-facing veranda furnished with armchairs &amp; a hammock from which guests can observe playful lemurs in the nearby trees.
In the main lodge, you will find a comfortable lounge, bar &amp; billiards table as well as a main restaurant where delicious Malagasy meals are served.  The massive 200 square meter swimming pool looks out over a lush lawn, usually littered with parakeets &amp; brown lemurs.

#### Activities
Activities tend to be exclusive, such as boat trips for 2 or intimate al fresco dinners in the gardens.
The long, sandy beach in front of the villas is for swimming &amp; relaxation.  A second beach around the corner attracts sports fanatics who want to try snorkelling, water-skiing, canoeing or windsurfing.  Fishing excursions can also be arranged.
Land-based sports include volleyball, table tennis, badminton, billiards, boules &amp; walks in the 750-hectare private reserve next to the lodge.
