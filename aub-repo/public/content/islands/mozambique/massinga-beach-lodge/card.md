### Massinga Beach Lodge

#### Experience
Massinga Beach Lodge is set along the edge of a hill above an endless stretch of Indian Ocean coastline in southern Mozambique.
The resort is set amongst coconut trees &amp; looks out over an endless stretch of sandy beach – the ideal setting for a honeymoon, special celebration or just family time.  
Massinga guests are invited to go on a technology detox!  Relaxation is key here, so you will not find any TVs or Wifi in the rooms.  Only the sound of the calm Indian Ocean. (There is limited Wifi in reception.)

#### Stay
Accommodation comprises 16 ocean-front deluxe chalets &amp; 12 ocean view chalets, each offering glorious views over the beach &amp; sea.
Each ocean-front deluxe chalet features a private deck with a splash pool – the perfect spot to enjoy whale watching in season or gaze at the beautiful star-filled galaxy at night. 
Designed with families in mind, each ocean view chalet features a relaxing lounge leading onto a large deck with ocean views.
At the main lodge, you will find a unique beach bar &amp; pool, set amongst natural boulders &amp; overlooking the sea.  The relaxing lounge &amp; cosy library are wonderful relaxation spots.

On-site activities include surfing, snorkelling at Fingers Rock, coconut cutting demonstrations, fishing &amp; beach walks.  Other exciting options include volleyball, table tennis, pool, darts, air hockey, cricket &amp; football.  Guests can also play board games or read a book from the library.
