### Azura Benguerra Island

#### Experience
Imagine an unspoilt island with deserted beaches of pure, white sand that extend for miles.  Imagine sparkling turquoise waters, sunny days &amp; lush palm trees.  Imagine Azura Benguerra Island.  
Situated on Benguerra Island – a private island that is home to only 3 resorts - within Mozambique’s Bazaruto Archipelago, Azura is only accessible by helicopter.  
Azura Benguerra is one of Mozambique’s most stylish island retreats &amp; provides only the best in barefoot luxury, along with superb diving &amp; snorkelling. 
The resort is popular among honeymooners because each elegant beach villa comes with a private butler, plunge pool &amp; romantic day sala – the perfect blend for a romantic stay.
