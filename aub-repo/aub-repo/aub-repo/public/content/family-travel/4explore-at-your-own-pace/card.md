Both these countries have fantastic infrastructure &amp; spectacular scenery to enjoy along the way – the ideal combination for an exciting road trip adventure!
South Africa stands out above the rest when it comes to family-friendly lodges &amp; activities – so of, course we’ll recommend that you make this beautiful country your first pit stop.
