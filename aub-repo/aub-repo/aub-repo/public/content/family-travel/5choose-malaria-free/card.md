CHOOSE MALARIA-FREE
Everyone will agree that Africa is a bucket list destination – even if you are pregnant or travelling with young kids.
Malaria-free is the way to go!  This means that you can still go on safari, visit an island or explore a city without missing out on anything.  After all – having kids is a blessing, so travelling with them to Africa should be a joy too.
Journey with us as we share our favourite malaria-free regions with you.  Remember though, now you have no excuse!
