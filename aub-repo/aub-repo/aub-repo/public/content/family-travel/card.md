### Family Travel

Happy kids – happy parents. This is the recipe for a successful family holiday!
This is where we come in. At Africa Unwind, our job is to ensure that careful planning goes into your family safari vacation or beach getaway, ensuring that you & your little ones have the time of your lives.
From witnessing close-up animal encounters & sleeping in a treehouse to exciting treasure hunts & swimming with dolphins – Africa has it all!
Want to know more?
Here are our top 6 reasons why an African family safari or island-style getaway is your best choice:
#### WITNESS FASCINATING ANIMAL ENCOUNTERS
Travelling to Africa with your family means one thing – the best family safari holiday ever! This bucket list activity is why most visitors choose Africa as their holiday destination. And if you ever want to see true excitement on a child’s face – bring them along! Apart from experiencing family game drives while on safari, kids can also enjoy elephant-back rides, walk with penguins on the beach, have breakfast with giraffes or interact with meerkats. You can also watch baby turtles nest on a postcard-perfect island or witness whales calve from a boat.
#### STAY IN PRIVATE VILLAS
Family travel can be tricky when it comes to finding the right accommodation. Private villas are often the best way to go. Whether youchoose a luxury family safari lodge, or an ocean-view suite, you’ll have everything you need for a true home-away-from-home experience & enjoy the added benefit of dedicated staff who will look after your every need.
#### HAVE FUN AT THE KIDS CLUB
In Africa, fun is around every corner. Many beach resorts & safari lodges boast dedicated Kids Clubs that offer a wide selection of fun-filled activities for your little ones. Should parents wish to enjoy a quiet dinner every so often, kids can play their hearts out at the Kids Club or alternatively, babysitting can be arranged.
#### EXPLORE AT YOUR OWN PACE
Families are often independent travellers who like to explore at their own pace, without being tied down to a certain schedule. That is where self-drive holidays come into play. Certain countries in Africa have great infrastructure that allows for safe & easy self-drive vacations.
#### CHOOSE MALARIA-FREE
There are many African destinations that are malaria-free – which means that you can still go on your dream family safari vacation, soak up the sun on a tropical island or enjoy adventurous activities with your kids - even while you are pregnant. We are here to recommend the best malaria-free family-friendly destinations – just ask.
#### ENJOY FAMILY-FRIENDLY ACTIVITIES
Our beautiful continent offers a long list of family-friendly activities, so rest assured that no one will get bored during an African family vacation. Whether you are coming face to face with a lion (from the comfort & safety of a safari jeep), riding on the back of an elephant, ziplining through a forest, riding on a quad bike or going on a treasure hunt – Africa will thrill the whole family!
