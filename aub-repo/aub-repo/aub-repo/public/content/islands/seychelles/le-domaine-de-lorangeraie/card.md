### Le Domaine de L'Orangeraie

#### Experience
Hidden away on the beautiful island of La Digue, which is said to be one of the most unspoiled islands in the Seychelles, lies Le Domaine de L’Orangeraie.
This peaceful resort is all about slowing down &amp; enjoying island life to its fullest.  Snorkelling, diving, sunbathing &amp; relaxing spa treatments will help you get there – fast.  
What is better than waking up to the crystal-clear waters of the Indian Ocean &amp; exploring the island on a mountain bike?
Transfers are by boat - either direct from Mahe (3 hours) or via a short flight to Praslin followed by a 45-minute ferry ride.  Private helicopter transfers with Zili Air can also be arranged.

#### Stay
The resort boasts 63 gorgeous luxury villas, all conveniently located just a 2-minute walk from the beach.
These villa categories include garden villas, garden suites, Villa de Charme, Villa de Charme Elegance &amp; the opulent Villa Presidentiele that can sleep up to 6 guests.
All air-conditioned villas offer an en-suite bathroom, outdoor shower &amp; private terrace.
Le Domaine de L’Orangeraie’s main areas include an ocean-front pool, 2 restaurants &amp; 2 bars, a wellness spa &amp; a cosy library.  Free snorkel gear &amp; bikes are available to Le Domaine guests.

#### Activities
Life is slow in the Seychelles, so lazy days are usually spent snorkelling, fishing, sunbathing or discovering secluded coves along the beach.  
For the more energetic traveller, mountain biking &amp; exciting boat cruises can also be arranged.  
Guests can also visit the museum at L’Union Coconut Plantation or go to Anse Source d’Argent -one of the most photographed beaches in the world.
