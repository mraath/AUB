### Anvil Bay

#### Experience
Set deep within the Maputo Special Reserve on the southern coast of Mozambique, lies the eco-friendly Anvil Bay. 
This conservation area protects a pristine stretch of tropical coastline &amp; its abundant wildlife such as hippo, giraffe, zebra &amp; elephants.
Anvil Bay offers the best of both worlds:  adventurous water-based activities like snorkelling, diving &amp; boating – along with superb wildlife activities like whale watching, turtle nesting, bird watching &amp; game viewing.

#### Stay
Accommodation comprises only 9 timber-&amp;-thatch suites (known as casinhas) at camp, each tucked into a shady coastal forest only a few meters from the beach.  One of these is a family casinha &amp; another a honeymoon suite.
Each casinha is built on wooden stilts &amp; features an en-suite bathroom with an indoor &amp; outdoor shower as well as a private deck, offering magnificent views over the beach.
The family casinha consists of 2 bedrooms, sleeping 4 guests, along with a shared bathroom &amp; outdoor bath with ocean views.
Private &amp; romantic, the honeymoon suite is situated far from the main beach area &amp; boasts an en-suite bathroom with an indoor &amp; outdoor shower as well as a private deck with direct beach access.
Communal areas include a lounge, bar, library &amp; dining area.

#### Activities
Activities at Anvil Bay include non-motorized activities like beach bikes, forest walks, picnics, sea kayaking, stand-up paddleboarding, bodyboarding, snorkelling, sundowners &amp; fishing.  Turtle encounters are from August to March.
