# ISLANDS
## Unwind With Us
### ISLANDS

Life is busy. So let’s be honest – all of us deserve some pampering every now & again. For some – pampering means strolling on white, sandy beaches with crystal clear water, while others enjoy eating fresh seafood or sipping on a cocktail while watching the sunset on islands in Africa. There are those who prefer lying in a hammock or getting a relaxing massage while others want to dive, snorkel & explore the island through adventure activities.
Relaxation is important - but in case you still need further convincing, here are our top 6 reasons why you should book a holiday on an island off the coast of Africa today.
#### THE ULTIMATE BEACH EXPERIENCE
Islands in Africa truly offer a slice of paradise. Breathtaking scenery, azure waters & palm-fringed beaches invite you to come & experience only the best in barefoot luxury.
#### SEE THE OCEAN FROM YOUR ROOM
There is nothing quite like lying on your bed, sitting on your patio or relaxing in your hammock while looking out over the quiet waters of the Indian Ocean. Island resorts are known to offer beautiful sea-facing rooms, so guests can indulge in luxury while still feeling close to nature.
#### PLENTY OF WATER SPORTS
An island holiday is incomplete without a scuba diving or snorkelling experience. Get up close & personal with the rich marine life or enjoy other thrilling water-based activities such as kayaking, paddle-boarding, jet-skiing or sailing.
GET UNPLUGGED…&amp; RECHARGE
For many of us, being on an island is living the dream. It gives us the chance to get away from the hustle & bustle of everyday life. Switch off your phone, take off your shoes & get refreshed.
#### EAT WITH YOUR FEET IN THE SAND
When we are at our best, we want to eat the best. Island-life in Africa is all about being outdoors & tasting fresh seafood from the ocean.
#### A HOLIDAY FOR ALL
Island holidays are for everyone - from adventurers, honeymooners & families, to couples & groups of friends. In addition to a variety of water sports, island resorts offer a wide selection of activities, including spa treatments, hiking, biking, cooking courses & Kids Clubs.
