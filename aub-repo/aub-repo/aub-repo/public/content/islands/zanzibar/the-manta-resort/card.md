### The Manta Resort

#### Experience
Situated in the far north of Tanzania’s Pemba Island, Manta Resort is the quintessential secluded island getaway that is on everyone’s bucket list!
Overlooking a pristine, white beach with a vibrant coral reef, this is the perfect holiday destination for blissful honeymoons or fun family getaways.  
The Manta Resort delivers a tropical paradise experience, coupled with exceptional service &amp; fresh cuisine from the crystal-clear ocean.
Probably its biggest drawing card is the unique glass-fronted ‘underwater room’ that is situated within a conservation area &amp; surrounded by coral.  Guests will submerge themselves into the Indian Ocean to experience its beautiful marine life &amp; quiet waters.

#### Stay
The Manta Resort offers a wide range of accommodation to suit your needs.  These include the standard garden rooms, superior garden rooms, seafront villas &amp; the popular underwater room.  All rooms are en-suite.
The standard garden rooms are compact, open-plan in design &amp; feature small balconies overlooking the garden.
In addition, the superior garden rooms boast large Swahili baraza lounges where guests can relax in the peacefulness of the garden.
Offering sensational ocean views, the seafront villas have a state-of-the-art EveningBreeze cooling system that cools &amp; cleans the air, promising a good night’s sleep.
The famed underwater room is a 3-storey glass-fronted suite where your bedroom is 4 metres below the water.  At night, spotlights illuminate the reef &amp; passing fish, allowing you to enjoy underwater wildlife viewing from the comfort of your bed!
The main area features a lounge, dining room, bar &amp; swimming pool.
