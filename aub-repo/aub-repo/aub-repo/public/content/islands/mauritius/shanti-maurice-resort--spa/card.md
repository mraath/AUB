Situated on one of the best beaches in Mauritius, Shanti Maurice is passionate about keeping the area peaceful &amp; tranquil.  No motorized watersports are allowed on this pristine beach, so guests can anticipate a rejuvenating &amp; relaxing island experience.
The resort is known for its superb award-winning spa – one of Africa’s largest tropical island spas - including nutritional advice, personal training, Pilates, as well as a full range of massage &amp; specialized treatments.
