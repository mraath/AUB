### LUX Le Morne

#### Experience
LUX Le Morne is a luxury resort set in a beautiful, protected bay along the Le Morne peninsula lagoon on the southwest coast of Mauritius.
Surrounded by lush, tropical gardens &amp; spectacular views of the ocean, Le Morne is the ideal retreat for an idyllic island getaway.
A popular phrase in Mauritius is ‘West is best’ - &amp; it is here, on the south-west coast, where one can witness the best sunsets on the island, be that from the unique ‘floating lounge’ boat where a private butler will take care of your every need, or from the soft, sandy beach.
Sun umbrellas are dotted along the beach, while many swimming pools overlook the lagoon with its coral reefs &amp; turquoise waters – the perfect spot for water sports.

#### Stay
Set against a cliff, the 149-room LUX Le Morne provides a luxury beach vacation with all the trimmings.  All rooms feature air-conditioning &amp; en-suite bathrooms.
Resort facilities include 4 swimming pools, consisting of a lap pool located at the spa, one in the gardens, an infinity pool with ocean views, &amp; the main pool at the centre of the resort.
LUX Le Morne also features 4 restaurants offering excellent cuisine, &amp; 2 bars – one of which becomes a vibrant lounge at night with live music.  
The spa encourages guests to design their own combined spa-&amp;-fitness program from the ‘Me Time’ Spa Menu.  And the resort’s Kids &amp; Teens Clubs - PLAY &amp; Studio 17 – both offer age-appropriate activities with staff supervision.

#### Activities
