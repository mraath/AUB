### Lokanga Boutique Hotel

#### Experience
Perched on a hill high above the capital, Antananarivo - &amp; only a few steps from the Queen’s Palace, lies the historical Lokanga Boutique Hotel – a secluded haven situated in the oldest part of ‘Tana’ where the queen’s musicians &amp; English missionaries used to live.
The area’s musical past influenced the name of this boutique hotel, so ‘lokanga’, a traditional Malagasy violin, was aptly chosen.
Away from the constant hustle &amp; bustle of downtown Tana, Lokanga Boutique Hotel was built by a wealthy family in the 1930s with the aim to celebrate Madagascar’s golden sunsets.
Their large west-facing terrace is the perfect place to enjoy 180-degree panoramic views &amp; settle down over an iced drink after a day of sightseeing.
This romantic neighbourhood with its cobbled streets is filled with ancient red-brick houses – a picture-postcard setting for avid photographers.

#### Stay
Accommodation comprises only 6 luxury rooms, all with breathtaking views over the city.  The owners have restored the rooms with beautiful antiques, original to the house.
Each individually decorated room features an en-suite bathroom, some of which have showers while some have bathtubs.  Rooms are reached via the original staircase.  Extra single beds can be added in some rooms for children.
Lokanga Boutique Hotel boasts a lovely garden with purple-flowered jacaranda trees, a terrace with sensational views &amp; an on-site restaurant that serves delicious Malagasy-inspired meals.

#### Activities
Guests can enjoy sightseeing tours to the Queen’s Palace, Lake Anosy, Lemur Park, Botanical Gardens &amp; Andafiavaratra Palace or visit one of the nearby flea markets.
Back at the hotel, they can savour delicious meals from the on-site restaurant or enjoy beautiful sunsets from the hotel terrace.
