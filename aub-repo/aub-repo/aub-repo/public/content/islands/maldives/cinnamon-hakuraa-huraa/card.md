### Cinnamon Hakuraa Huraa

#### Experience
Cinnamon Hakuraa Huraa is situated on Meemu Atoll, one of the largest shallow lagoons amongst the Maldivian resorts – &amp; a prime setting for taking beautiful photos.
After a 45-minute seaplane ride from Male International Airport, your dream island awaits.
The Maldives islands are a paradise for couples in love, &amp; Hakuraa Huraa is an ideal choice for romantics who are looking for a private &amp; tranquil island getaway.
Honeymooners are invited to the Platinum Island – an adults-only haven at Cinnamon Hakuraa Huraa Maldives completely removed from the rest of the resort, and home to a private pool, Manzaru Restaurant, Vevu Bar and Lounge, and the sumptuous Platinum Beach Bungalows.  If you’re looking for ultimate privacy, this is it.
Their world-class spa offers a range of relaxing massage &amp; beauty treatments &amp; the water bar on stilts is the perfect place to relax with a cocktail in hand.

#### Stay
Facing out towards the lagoon, exclusive water or beach bungalows offer comfort &amp; spacious layouts, classic wood furnishings &amp; a seating area.  There are also platinum beach bungalows that are located on the nearby adult-only private island.
Each water bungalow features a hammock that is set over the crystal-clear lagoon, a glass floor in the living room offering a glimpse into the marine life below &amp; direct access from the overwater bungalow to the lagoon via a private terrace.
The spacious beach bungalows are nestled among the trees of the main island &amp; include private verandas with sofas where guests can relax &amp; soak up the views of the Indian Ocean.
The platinum beach bungalows are secreted away on Platinum Island for the ultimate privacy &amp; romance.  This island is only accessible to guests above the age of 18.

#### Activities
For leisure, water sports such as canoeing, snorkelling and windsurfing are available. 
Alternatively, guests can have a good workout at the fitness centre or enjoy soothing massages at Cinnamon Hakuraa Huraa’s spa.
