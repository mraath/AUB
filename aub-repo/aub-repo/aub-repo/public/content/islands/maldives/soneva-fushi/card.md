### Soneva Fushi

#### Experience
The Maldives is made up of 1,190 coral islands spread across the waters of the Indian Ocean.  
In the northwest within the Baa Atoll – a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve - you will find Soneva Fushi, one of the Maldives’ largest private islands.
After a 30-minute seaplane ride from Male International Airport, your dream island awaits.
At 1,400 meters long &amp; almost 400 meters wide, Suneva Fushi provides only the best in barefoot luxury.  This original desert island hideaway is large by Maldives standards - &amp; home to perfect beaches, a vibrant reef encircling the island, a colony of nesting turtles &amp; its very own world-class observatory.

#### Stay
Surrounded by lush palm jungle, luxury beach &amp; water villas overlook the Indian Ocean &amp; enjoy direct private access to the beach.  Signature bathrooms are set within a large private garden with outdoor showers &amp; separate bathtubs.
Inspired by Robinson Crusoe, a butler called Barefoot Butler will attend to your needs &amp; assist with your holiday desires.
There are 6 on-site island restaurants &amp; over 500 wines in the well-stocked cellar.  
Guests can also choose between a variety of nature’s ‘open air’ restaurants, like having breakfast on your private deck or enjoying a romantic picnic on a sandbank or a deserted island.

#### Activities
Suneva Fushi offers a range of non-motorized island activities, like diving, snorkelling, sailing, windsurfing, kayaking, kite surfing &amp; champagne sunset cruises.
Some of Soneva’s unique activities include the open-air Cinema Paradiso, astronomy nights in the high-tech Observatory &amp; making delicious treats in the homemade chocolate &amp; ice-cream rooms.  Soneva is also home to the Maldives’ only glass blowing studio.
Guests can also spend an overnight at the Sandbank for a private &amp; remote island experience under the stars or sail aboard Sonvea’s luxury 2-bedroom yacht, Soneva in Aqua.
