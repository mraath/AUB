#### Experience
Sunny skies, white sandy beaches &amp; crystal clear water…It is not hard to enjoy a holiday in the Maldives. Relax, sip on a cocktail or snorkel next to your palm-fringed water villa. 
The Maldives is comprised of 1,190 coral islands, of which 200 are inhabited &amp; only 98 are tourist resorts. This string of idyllic islands is encircled by translucent, ever-changing waters of the Indian Ocean, offering beach-lovers the chance to discover a luxurious island retreat like no other.
As far as the eye can see, you will find a skyline of coconut palm trees, snow-white sand beaches &amp; vibrant coral reefs. This tropical oasis also offers world-class diving &amp; snorkelling as well as a range of other water-based activities that can keep you busy for days.
Water-lovers can spot turtles, whale sharks, reef manta rays & colossal whales while others can enjoy unforgettable luxury spa treatments in the comfort of their suite.
The Maldives is also well-known for its gourmet dining. Resorts offer a wide range of international dishes, including Italian, Japanese, Thai, Indian &amp; French cuisine. The country has become a hot spot for Michelin-starred chefs who are happy to show off their skills.

#### Stay
The must-visit islands in the Maldives are geared towards the discerning traveller who is looking for a luxurious island holiday.
Surrounded by turquoise blue waters, most resorts offer guests 3 types of accommodation: luxury water villas, elegant beach villas or private villas. Visitors can even split their stay between a beach stay &amp; a water villa experience. 
Some villas have private plunge pools, others have outdoor showers – but all of them offer the highest standard of luxury.

#### When to travel
The island is warm &amp; sunny year-round, but consists of a dry season and a wet, rainy season.
