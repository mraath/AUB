### Honeymoons

There are many reasons why so many couples choose a luxury honeymoon in Africa.
#### 
The options are endless for Africa honeymoon packages, from romantic boutique camps with private plunge pools, to nights under the stars on private wildlife concessions. There are beaches & tropical islands, hot air balloon rides over savannah plains & candle-lit dinners in remote settings.
#### 
You can have it all, beach and bush, or choose an African safari honeymoon alone - whatever your choice, you won’t regret it!
#### 
Trust us on this one: African honeymoons are the perfect recipe for romance, here’s why:
#### 
#### EXPERIENCE AFRICA IN LUXURY
An African honeymoon will sweep you off your feet – literally! Our selection of luxurious lodges, boutique hotels & private villas is the perfect starting point for an idyllic getaway as newlyweds. Some lodges offer private viewing decks & plunge pools while others boast romantic outdoor showers & comfortable day beds. Whether you choose a remote wildlife reserve or a private island – luxury is always the aim.
#### TAKE A DIP IN A PRIVATE PLUNGE POOL
What is more magical than cooling off in your very own pool overlooking the bush or beach? Luxury honeymoons in Africa are all about spending quality time with your loved one, so why not soak up the sun & enjoy spectacular views from the comfort of your private pool? Many plunge pools overlook the crystal-clear waters of the Indian Ocean & some even enjoy views over a game-packed waterhole.
#### INDULGE IN ROMANCE
In Africa, romance is around every corner. Enjoy a private candle-lit dinner on the beach (or in the bush), relish in a couples’ massage while listening to the sounds of the wild or take a scenic hot air balloon flight over the vast open plains.
#### SLEEP UNDER A CANOPY OF STARS
When it comes to romance, sometimes less is more. Africa boasts a wonderful selection of romantic sleepouts – from luxurious open-air treehouses & rooftop experiences to more adventurous sleepouts like fly-camping in mobile tents.
#### ENJOY BESPOKE SAFARI ACTIVITIES
The word safari means ‘journey,’ so whichever journey you choose for your African safari honeymoon, we will ensure that it is a memorable one. We realize that honeymooners appreciate time alone, so we will do our best to arrange specialized, private activities where possible. Be that during dinner time, on a game drive or while watching the sunset from a romantic lookout point.
#### SOAK UP THE SCENERY
African honeymoons are all about re-connecting with each other & with nature – often in secluded settings. Whether you are surrounded by white, sandy beaches, lush green vineyards, rugged mountains or vast open plains – we will ensure that your views are breathtaking!
