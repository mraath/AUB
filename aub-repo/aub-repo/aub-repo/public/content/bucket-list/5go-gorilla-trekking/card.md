### 5Go Gorilla-Trekking

GO GORILLA-TREKKING
Talking about Bucket List adventures?  Look no further, because trekking through the jungles of Africa &amp; coming face to face with endangered mountain gorillas is as good as it gets!
The fact that gorillas as a species are on the verge of extinction &amp; treks are a highly restricted activity, puts gorilla-trekking on top of the list when it comes to once-in-a-lifetime travel experiences.
The rainforest is a challenging environment, so if you want to trek, you need to be fairly fit, in good health &amp; equipped for humid, muddy conditions.  Even in the dry season, the steep slopes &amp; thick vegetation can be challenging for some, but if you’re up for the hike, it is worth every moment.
Gorillas are susceptible to human illnesses, but don’t have our immunities – so a common cold can be fatal to a gorilla family, which means that you won’t be able to trek if you are unwell.
You are not allowed to use a flash when taking a picture &amp; have to wear a protective face mask when approaching the gorillas to prevent spreading viral &amp; bacterial diseases from humans to primates.
Each group (a maximum of 6 guests) is led by a professional guide &amp; tracker that will take you into the thick of the forest, in search of a habituation gorilla family.  Once found, you’ll be able to spend an hour with the gorillas, watching the adults groom each other &amp; the babies tumble &amp; play.
Those wishing to spend more time with the gorillas can purchase a Gorilla Habituation permit, which will allow them – along with researchers &amp; park rangers – to help train gorillas to get used to people.  Gorilla Habituation may take between 2 to 3 years to be completed, so being able to actively engage in conservation is an experience of a lifetime.
Chimp-trekking is quite different to gorilla-trekking.  Although the trekking conditions are much easier, they are wary of humans &amp; a little harder to find.  Chimps &amp; other primate species can also be seen on a gorilla-trek – but there are several other superb chimpanzee trekking destinations like Uganda’s Kibale Forest, Queen Elizabeth National Park &amp; Murchison Falls National Park or Rwanda’s Nyungwe Forest National Park.  You can also spot them in Tanzania’s Mahale Mountains National Park &amp; Gombe Stream National Park.
If you are coming all the way to Africa, you may as well add a gorilla safari to your itinerary.  After all, it is a once-in-a-lifetime experience that will leave you with lasting memories.
For the best gorilla-trekking adventure, visit one of the following African destinations.
1. Volcanoes National Park – Rwanda
The beautiful Volcanoes National Park in north-western Rwanda is Rwanda’s prime rainforest &amp; home to 5 of 8 volcanoes in the Virunga Mountains range.  The park was also the base for the revolutionary primatologist, Dian Fossey, &amp; is home to a staggering amount of mountain gorillas, rare golden monkeys &amp; a variety of forest birds.  
2. Bwindi Impenetrable National Park – Uganda
The mountain gorillas of Uganda can be found in Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park – a World Heritage Site of both montane &amp; lowland forest that is home to 120 species of mammals, 350 bird species &amp; 220 butterfly species.  Hosting half of the world’s population of mountain gorillas, Bwindi also offers thrilling encounters with colobus monkeys &amp; chimpanzees.
