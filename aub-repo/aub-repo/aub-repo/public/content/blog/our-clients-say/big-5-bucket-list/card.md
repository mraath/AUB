# Big 5 Bucket List
## Our Clients Say
### Big 5 Bucket List

We had a fantastic trip!!  Where do I begin??

We loved all the camps.  Our favourite was probably Nottens, but our favourite location was Moremi.  The scenery and animals there were just so beautiful!  Each camp had something special and unique to offer.  

At Savute, the camp and the rooms were beautiful and we loved having the watering hole right in front to watch elephants and other animals drink day and night.  And the staff at Savute Safari Lodge were absolutely incredible.  They were so warm and friendly, and we felt like we really got to know them.  

Camp Xakanaxa was beautiful, as was all of Moremi.  The staff there were also great and our guide, TS, was our favourite guide of the trip.  He was very knowledgeable and really fun! We would definitely go back to Moremi!  

In South Africa we had some incredible wild dog encounters at Simbavati.  The property and the rooms were stunning!  And then Nottens was so special - we loved everyone there and loved that the rooms were more cabin like and had baths overlooking the game viewing area.  We also loved that we could walk around the property alone at night without a guide - that felt freeing!  And we had some truly incredible animal encounters in Sabi Sands.  We saw wild dogs fighting over a kill with a leopard and then another fight over a different kill between the wild dogs and hyena. 

We had a really special experiences at each place!
