# Another Travel Blog
## Because Travel Is Everything
### Another Travel Blog

“Another travel blog?” you ask.  Well, yes. Because – for most of us, our favourite memories happen while on holiday.  Perhaps it is because we forget the rat race, the job, the responsibilities & the dog at home (of course you got a sitter), & we focus on the things that really matter.  People. 

You’ll hear us talk about people often, because – if we are truly honest with ourselves – life revolves around doing things together.  Sure, travel is always fun, but sharing an adventure with someone is even better!

Have you ever sat around a dinner table & listened to someone’s amazing (& often funny) travel stories? “The day we missed our flight & got upgraded to first class.”  “That time we couldn’t get to our chalet, because a hippo was blocking the door.” “Remember when we slept in the treehouse & got woken up by the roar of a lion?”  

Travel stories inspire us.  Not only does it encourage us to get on a plane & see the world, but it inspires us to dream, to see the bigger picture & to live life to the fullest.

That is why we have decided to build a luxury travel company that helps people broaden their horizons.  At Africa Unwind we not only custom design your safari holiday, but we also travel the length & breadth of Africa to provide you with first-hand knowledge, professional travel tips & exceptional service.

So yes, this is another travel blog.  About Africa.  About ‘all things travel.’

Why don’t you join us?  Come to Africa…& Unwind.
