# Spa Surprise
## We Say
### Spa Surprise

If you know me well, you’ll know that I get excited about these 3 things:  People, travel &amp; spa treatments!
So, when our friends decided to spoil us with a spa day, we could not refuse.  (Everyone needs friends like ours!)
The thought of getting pampered, detoxing in the steam room &amp; swimming in a heated pool got us so excited, we decided to stay the entire weekend.
And the reason I am blogging about this, is because we all know how amazing (&amp; tiring) travel can be.  When booking a holiday, we spend so much time exploring the area, dining out &amp; taking pictures, that we forget about the ‘unwinding part of the trip!’ 
So, I say: ‘Go for it!”  Treat yourself.  By all means – explore, travel &amp; repeat.  But balance it with something that relaxes you.  For me, that is massages &amp; facials!
So off we went…
Upon arrival at Majeka House, a boutique hotel set in the historic town of Stellenbosch in the Cape Winelands, we checked into our room &amp; decided to spend the afternoon relaxing by the heated pool.  After sunset, we enjoyed a lovely dinner next to the fireplace – the perfect ending to a day in the Winelands.  We particularly enjoyed their healthy poke bowls – in fact – we had it twice during our stay!
The next morning, after a delicious breakfast served in the restaurant overlooking lush gardens, we were ready for our day of pampering!
The Wellness Spa at Majeka House offers a wide range of spa treatments, including the complimentary use of the heated pool, steam room, sauna &amp; Jacuzzi.
Their Spa Menu includes massages, facials, body wraps &amp; scrubs, hand &amp; feet treatments, waxing, nail treatments &amp; much more.  
You are also more than welcome to tailor your own package from their Spa Menu.
We decided on the Majeka Magic Package, which includes a 45 min back &amp; foot massage, a 60 min bespoke facial &amp; a lunch.  This package is tailored to couples, so we were booked into the larger treatment room with 2 massage beds.
Their well-trained &amp; experienced therapists were attentive to our personal needs &amp; treated us like royalty.
After our pampering session, we put on white, fluffy robes &amp; enjoyed an amazing lunch in the gardens.  The rest of the day was spent reading on the pool loungers, swimming &amp; detoxing in the steam room &amp; Jacuzzi.
When travelling, we enjoy staying at properties that offer spa facilities, because there is always time for a little bit of pampering.  
Most of Africa Unwind’s clients enjoy booking private tours to Cape Town &amp; the Winelands, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t time for a relaxing treatment in the afternoon.  
Or even better – stay an extra night &amp; get pampered properly before flying back home!
Aren’t holidays about relaxing…?  So, do that!
Come to Africa…&amp; Unwind.
