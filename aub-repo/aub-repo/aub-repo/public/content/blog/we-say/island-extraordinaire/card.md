# Island Extraordinaire
## We Say
### Island Extraordinaire

There are two things that excite me when it comes to travel:  Islands &amp; luxury…And for some reason, these two things are like cookies &amp; cream – they create the perfect balance to a holiday.
So, from now on I will refer to this term (Islands + Luxury) as ‘Island Extraordinaire’, because if you continue to read until the end, you’ll understand why our recent trip to Mozambique was exactly that - Extraordinary!
Since I was a young girl, I dreamt about being whisked away to a romantic island retreat where my villa was right on the sand.  I have always wanted to be surrounded by turquoise blue water &amp; palm trees while eating fresh seafood on the beach…We would watch a romantic sunset, enjoy adventurous watersports &amp; get pampered at the spa…&amp; then I would wake up!
Well, this time, my dream would become a reality! 
“Finally,” I thought.
My husband &amp; I were getting ready for our secluded island getaway to Mozambique’s Bazaruto Archipelago - the combined name for 6 idyllic islands which lie just off the mainland between Vilanculos &amp; Inhassoro.  We were ecstatic to be calling Benguerra Island home for the next week! 
We have heard that this island is known for its unspoilt beauty &amp; diverse ecologies, so “excited” was probably a bit of an understatement!
There are only 3 luxury retreats on the entire island, &amp; we were going to stay at 2 of them.
OK, if you are reading this - fasten your seatbelt – you are about to be blown away!!
Upon arrival at Vilanculos Airport, we were met by a friendly staff member &amp; taken to a VIP lounge in a quite corner of the airport, where we could enjoy welcome drinks before our transfer arrived.  Shortly after, our pilot arrived &amp; escorted us to our private helicopter.  Yes, you heard right – private helicopter!  Blown away yet?
The 20-minute helicopter trip was simply spectacular!  Looking down at the turquoise blue ocean while spotting the odd traditional dhow boat made me feel like pinching myself.
“Welcome to your dream island,” I thought as the helicopter came to a standstill.
After a warm island greeting, the staff showed us around Benguerra Island Lodge - one of the most sought-after African island destinations – known for offering the best in laidback island luxury.  
It wasn’t hard to fall in love with our beach villa &amp; its beautiful surrounds.  Accommodation comprises 2 beautiful cabanas &amp; 10 slightly larger casitas that are built right on the edge of the beach, each boasting an outdoor shower, private deck with jacuzzi or plunge pool &amp; sun loungers.  
Each casita also includes a tastefully appointed lounge area, and outdoor sala &amp; an irresistible hanging daybed…where we spent most of our time!
They also cater for families!  The 3-bedroom, 3-bathroom Casa Familia is the epitome of exclusivity &amp; comes with a personal chef, outdoor showers, a lounge &amp; dining room, a private wooden deck with swimming pool &amp; direct beach access.
Communal areas include a massage sala, dive centre, beach bar &amp; lounge.
We stayed in one of the casitas &amp; felt like royalty!  The private pool was such a treat &amp; a wonderful place to relax between snorkelling, beach walks &amp;…well, eating.  Tough life, right?
One of the things that really stood out for us, was the service.  The staff were incredible &amp; nothing was too much trouble for them!  They asked us each day where we would like to have dinner &amp; our answer was always the same: “We would love a private beach dinner please…” - because what beats eating fresh seafood while watching the sun set over the ocean…barefoot?! And each time their reply was the same: “Sir, it is no problem!” (smiling)
So, there we were – on our remote Indian Ocean Island – with our feet in the sand, eating to our hearts content &amp; looking out over the sea, thinking: “Can we just stay forever?”
Every day was pure bliss!  We decided to use this time to really switch off, relax &amp; do as little as possible…except swim, sunbath, eat, nap, read &amp; snorkel – of course!  But if you want to do more activities – you can!  Their activity list includes scuba diving, Land Rover island drives, fishing, dhow cruises, castaway picnics &amp; birdwatching.  Other options are island walks, village visits, sea kayaking, catamaran cruises &amp; horse riding…Wow, that’s a mouthful!
Sunset is such a beautiful time on the island, so we decided to round off our stay with a romantic dhow cruise around the island. (a traditional sailing boat made by locals) It was so special to be sitting in a rustic wooden boat with a local Mozambican man who grew up on the island.  It was like being transported to another – very special – world.
After a few days at Benguerra Island Lodge, our open jeep transfer collected us &amp; whisked us away to our next stop:  Azura Benguerra Island – one of Mozambique’s most stylish island retreats.
After a very warm welcome, we were taken to our beach villa.  “Wow!”  And then – no words...Just happiness.  Each elegant beach villa comes with a private butler, a plunge pool &amp; a romantic day sala – the perfect blend for a romantic stay.  No wonder Azura Benguerra is a favourite among honeymooners.
There are a variety of villas for every type of client – as well as a family villa (sleeping 5 guests) &amp; a 3-bedroom, 3-bathroom presidential villa offering the ultimate in luxury.
The resort operates on a fully inclusive rate, which means that all meals, drinks, butler-service &amp; a variety of activities are included in your stay.  “Which activities are included?” you may ask.  Are you ready for it…? A scenic island drive by Land Rover, a sunset cocktail of the day served to your sala, the use of snorkelling equipment as well as kayaks &amp; paddleboards, a romantic sunset dhow cruise, a try scuba diving session in the pool, the use of Peri Peri Beach Club as well as honeymoon special treats &amp; various activities for kids.
Of course, there is a long list of other activities on offer at an additional cost.  These include reef snorkelling, island hopping, scuba diving, deep sea fishing, beach picnics &amp; spa treatments.
If you were wondering what a typical day at Azura looks like…Here we go!  After sleeping in, we woke up, opened our curtains &amp; looked out over the turquoise ocean.  After relaxing a bit on our beach sala (my husband with his coffee &amp; me with my orange juice), we had a lovely breakfast on the deck overlooking the ocean.  What a way to start the day!
Next up – snorkelling!  Both of us love being in the water, so we always prioritise a snorkel safari while on holiday.  After we met our friendly skipper, we headed out on a private speed boat to explore the Indian Ocean’s beautiful coral reefs.  And what a trip it was!  Surrounded by nothing except translucent waters, sea creatures &amp; coral – with no other boats or people in sight – we came face to face with technicoloured marine life that moved in droves along the exposed coral.  “Breathtaking,” we thought!
Our concierge at Azura recommended we do a castaway beach picnic…&amp; so we did.  On our way back, our skipper stopped at a small, private isle in the middle of the ocean, &amp; when we came closer – our mouths hung open as we looked at what was in store for us next.  A private beach picnic, packed out in style!  A canopy was set up for us - with plenty of shade, comfortable bean bags were laid out, along with fluffy towels, a cooler box full of our favourite drinks &amp; a table set up with a fresh seafood lunch.  “Sir, when would you like us to collect you again?” they asked.  We decided that 3 hours would be sufficient to enjoy all the picnic surprises, have a swim, lie in the sun &amp;…do a few handstands on our private isle!
So, there we were – in paradise!  With nothing &amp; nobody else in sight…except the fish!
After a very relaxing time - &amp; the most delicious meal – we saw something in the distance.  Our transfer….a private catamaran!  Our skipper welcomed us with a drink &amp; even asked us: “Sir, how fast would you like to go?”  After thinking a little, my husband replied: “Let’s go fast &amp; then go slow!”  Basking in the sun on our private catamaran, we felt so relaxed &amp; totally rejuvenated.  When we approached the island, our personal butler was waiting for us on the beach – with our favourite cocktail in hand!  
The sun was now setting, so after relaxing on our beach sala – cocktail in hand – we decided to go stand-up paddle boarding.  (One of our other favourite island activities!)  “What a day!” we thought – in the most positive sense. 
As we were standing on our boards, looking out over the orange skies &amp; quiet ocean, only one word came to mind: “Extraordinary!”
This time it was not a dream.
