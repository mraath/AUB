### Panorama Route

#### Experience
There’s plenty of things to do on the Panorama Route which is one of South Africa’s hidden gems & a destination that you should not travel to without a camera!
Just a stone’s throw away from the world-renowned Kruger Park, this breathtaking region consists of dramatic landscapes as far as the eye can see. Unspoilt mountains, majestic waterfalls & interesting canyons are just some of the natural wonders and scenic spots on the Panorama Route. 
The road conditions are easy & safe, so independent-minded self-drive guests will love exploring the Panorama Route at their own pace. Alternatively, a private guide can also take you to some of the region’s best sites, such as God’s Window, Three Rondavels viewpoint, Bourke’s Luck Potholes & Blyde River Canyon.
The Panorama Route’s charming little towns consists of Hazyview with its wide selection of outdoor activities, White River with its boutique shops, open-air restaurants & golf courses, Dullstroom where fly-fishing, hiking & horse-riding are at their best & Pilgrim’s Rest – the Panorama Route’s historic gold mining town set in a pretty location.

#### Activities
The Panorama Route offers a wide selection of activities & attractions. Scenic tours are usually first on the list, so guests can experience some of the area’s most beautiful sites, including waterfalls, canyons & quaint towns.
Elephant interactions at Hazyview’s Elephant Whispers Centre is a bucket list experience that should not be missed. Other exciting activities include zip lining, golf & game drives.

#### When to travel
The Panorama Route is beautiful in any season, but the most rewarding time to take a trip is in the cooler, dryer months between May & September – which also coincides with Kruger Park’s best safari season. The driving conditions during this time of year will be better and the views clearer.
