### Wine Route

#### Experience
Nestled between sun-kissed vineyards, majestic mountains &amp; picturesque valleys, the famous Wine Route in South Africa (also referred to as the Cape Winelands) is renowned for its exquisite wines, grand old estates, pretty towns &amp; award-winning restaurants.
Within only a 60-minute drive from vibrant Cape Town, you reach one of the most breathtaking regions in South Africa where Alpine-style views, art galleries &amp; quaint side-walk cafes are seen from almost every street.
The Cape Winelands generally refers to the 3 most popular wine-growing regions surrounding Cape Town: Franschhoek, Stellenbosch &amp; Paarl, each countryside setting as beautiful as the next.
Franschhoek is South Africa’s gourmet capital, so guests here can take their pick from a wide selection of award-winning restaurants &amp; wine &amp; gastronomy experiences. The oak tree-lined streets of Stellenbosch are dotted with art galleries, quaint coffee shops, boutiques &amp; side-walk cafes while the quiet town of Paarl provides a relaxing, off-the-beaten-track Winelands experience.
Explore the Wine Route, South Africa &amp; its variety of accommodation options that suit every type of traveller – from luxurious manor houses &amp; secluded boutique hotels to farm-style suites &amp; family-friendly villas.

#### Activities
Foodies &amp; wine lovers should – most definitely – add the Winelands to their bucket list! But this breathtaking region offers so much more than just food &amp; wine.
Guests can enjoy a long list of activities, including mountain biking, quad biking, hiking &amp; horse-riding. Other attractions include art galleries, museums, wellness spas &amp; shopping.
Families will be spoilt for choice in the Winelands. Fun family-friendly activities include animal encounters, grape juice &amp; chocolate tastings, wine farm picnics, strawberry picking, acrobranching (treetop obstacle courses) &amp; even eco-friendly, non-motorized scooter rides through the vineyards – great fun for the whole family. Some wine farms also offer authentic outdoor farm experiences specifically designed for the little ones.

#### When to travel
The best time to visit the Winelands is between October &amp; April when days are warm, dry &amp; sunny. Winter is between June &amp; August, but foodies can still enjoy rainy days next to a cosy fire.
