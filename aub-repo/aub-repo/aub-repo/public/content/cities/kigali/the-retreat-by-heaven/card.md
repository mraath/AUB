### The Retreat by Heaven

#### Experience
The Retreat by Heaven is arguably Kigali’s best premier boutique hotel.  Located in the heart of the capital, The Retreat provides a tranquil sanctuary after a long-haul flight or an exhilarating gorilla trek.
The hotel is a forerunner when it comes to lightening its environmental impact &amp; is therefore powered by sunlight.  
Their casual onsite restaurant – aptly named, Heaven – serves up fresh local produce turned into international dishes while Fushion serves fine dining cuisine with the indigenous garden &amp; pool as the backdrop.

#### Stay
The Retreat by Heaven offers 3 deluxe rooms, 8 superior suites, 3 master suites &amp; 8 luxury pool villas.  All rooms include en-suite bathrooms.  
The deluxe rooms have furnished patios while the superior suites have furnished front balconies, private back decks as well as separate sitting areas.
The master suites are slightly larger than the superior suites &amp; overlook the pool area.
The luxury pool villas boast private saltwater heated plunge pools as well as bedrooms with full living areas &amp; 120 square meters of indoor &amp; outdoor private living space.
The main area comprises a spa, gym, 2 restaurants, bar &amp; saltwater swimming pool.
