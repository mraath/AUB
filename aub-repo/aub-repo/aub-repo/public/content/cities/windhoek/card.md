## CITIES
### Windhoek

#### Experience
Namibia’s bustling capital, Windhoek is situated in a pretty valley, surrounded by rolling mountains &amp; has become the main port of call for tourists who pass through the city at least once.
The city offers the perfect blend between modern design &amp; old German colonial architecture, as well as a wide variety of accommodation choices that are ideal for couples, honeymooners, families &amp; friends.
The German presence can be strongly felt in the food, restaurants - &amp;, of course, the beer. The Namibian beer is said to be the best in Africa & it is brewed in Windhoek.
Known as one of Southern Africa’s most relaxed cities, Windhoek is an ideal overnight stay for guests who are doing a self-drive holiday through Namibia or who need to connect with a flight the following day.

#### Activities
There are plenty of things to do in Windhoek.
Activities include guided city tours, sampling Namibian beer at one of the sidewalk cafes or restaurants, go horseback riding or visit a local township.
Further afield, guests can visit The Cheetah Conservation Park, Namib Rand Natural Reserve &amp; the Namib Desert.

#### When to travel
Windhoek gets quite hot between December &amp; March but thanks to its altitude, humidity is low &amp; nights are pleasantly cool. The summer rains can be heavy but evaporation rates are high so it does not stay damp for long.
The winter months of May to August can get very cold at night with frost in low lying areas, but the days are warm, sunny and cloudless. Note that temperatures rise steeply during the September - November build-up to the rainy season.
