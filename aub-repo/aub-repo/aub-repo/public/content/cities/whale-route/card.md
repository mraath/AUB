## CITIES
### Whale Route

#### Experience
The scenic Whale Route is the Overberg region’s Indian Ocean coastline - &amp; also considered one of the most breathtaking drives in the country.
The Whale Route’s claim to fame is that it offers the best land-based whale watching in the world!
Each year between July &amp; November (the BEST time to do the Whale Trail), Southern Right whales &amp; Humpback whales migrate here to calve &amp; mate, so visitors can marvel at these gentle giants from one of the walking paths overlooking the ocean or from the comfort of a boat.
For the ultimate whale watching experience, avid photographers can also take to the skies for a spectacular bird’s eye view of the whales while capturing an incredible shot of mothers with their newborn calves, or large mating groups.
But whales are not the only reason to visit. The Whale Route has so much to offer – from majestic mountains &amp; beautiful beaches to nature reserves &amp; charming seaside towns.
At the heart of the Whale Route, you will find Hermanus - an old fishing village that has become a bustling town &amp; world-famed whale watching base.
For a more exclusive whale watching experience away from crowds, head further up the coast to De Kelders.
Thrill-seekers can head to Gansbaai for shark-cage diving while Cape Agulhas - the southernmost tip of Africa, is also worth exploring (It’s not just whale watching on the Whale Route!). 
Don’t miss Grootbos Nature Reserve &amp; De Hoop Nature Reserve &amp; the charming fishing village of Arniston.
Located only a 2-hour scenic drive from Cape Town, guests can quickly switch from ‘vibrant city’ to ‘relaxing seaside living.’

#### Activities
Exciting water-based activities include whale watching by boat, shark cage diving, kayaking, surfing, stand-up paddleboarding &amp; swimming.
Some land-based activities to choose from, include whale watching from one of the many viewpoints, hiking, golf, quad biking, horse-riding, bird watching &amp; shopping.

#### When to travel
The best time to explore the Whale Route in South Africa is in Winter &amp; Spring from July to November, so if whales are what you want to tick off your list, make sure to travel during these months. Summer is between December &amp; April when days are sunny &amp; warm – the ideal time for a beach holiday.
