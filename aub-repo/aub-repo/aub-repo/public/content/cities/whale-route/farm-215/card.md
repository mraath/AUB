### Farm 215

#### Experience
Farm 215 is a luxurious eco-friendly farm retreat that is so unique, it is in a class of its own.  Located off-the-beaten-track along the Whale Coast, guests will be immersed in nature – an ideal place to switch off &amp; truly relax.
Designed in keeping with its beautiful surroundings, Farm 215’s elegant suites boast lovely views over the fynbos reserve &amp; an organic vegetable &amp; herb garden produces fresh farm-to-table meals.
Completely off-the-beaten-track, yet close enough to the best land-based whale watching in the world, this farm retreat is passionate about the conservation of the Cape Floral Kingdom &amp; its rich wildlife.

#### Stay
Farm 215 consists of Homestead rooms &amp; Fynbos suites.  
The Homestead rooms are located within the main homestead &amp; offer spacious &amp; luxurious accommodation.  Two of the rooms are located on the first floor &amp; offer gorgeous views from their balconies, while the third room is located on the ground floor &amp; offers slightly more space, as well as a private garden &amp; covered terrace.
The fynbos suites offer a true Farm 215 experience.  They are incredibly spacious, totally private &amp; spaced out along a meandering pathway with captivating views over the reserve.  These solar-powered suites are open-plan &amp; boast a sundeck, as well as a lounge &amp; en-suite bathroom.  Each suite also has a fireplace for cosy winter evenings.
The bar &amp; dining area opens onto an expansive terrace where guests can enjoy beautiful views of nature while sipping a fine Cape wine.  There is also a 25m heated lap-pool for lazy afternoons.

#### Activities
Guests can enjoy many hiking trails on the farm or enjoy guided horse-riding excursions.  Day trips to Hermanus can also be arranged where guests can witness the world’s best land-based whale watching between July &amp; November each year.
