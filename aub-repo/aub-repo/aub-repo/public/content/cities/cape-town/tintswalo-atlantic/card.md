#### Experience
Perched above the Atlantic Ocean at the base of Chapman’s Peak, Tintswalo Atlantic offers a luxurious beachfront retreat with uninterrupted ocean views.  
Set just outside Cape Town, the lodge is built in a secluded cranny, offering romantics &amp; honeymooners a true ocean paradise.
Located only 20 minutes from Cape Town’s city centre, this boutique hotel is the perfect base from which to explore the city, as well as Camps Bay, Clifton &amp; Llandudno beaches.  
The lodge is built to blend seamlessly with the natural environment, ensuring optimum views of the sea &amp; natural surroundings.  Right in front of the lodge, guests can take a stroll down a pebbled beach – or drive out to the nearby sandy, main beach in the quaint fishing town of Hout Bay.

#### Stay
Tintswalo Atlantic boasts 11 suites, each authentically designed &amp; decorated to reflect elements of different well-known islands around the world, keeping to the lodge’s relaxed, yet sophisticated beach theme.
Suites all enjoy incredible views of the Atlantic Ocean &amp; offer supreme comfort &amp; privacy.  All suites are equipped with air-conditioning &amp; lavish furnishes.  En-suite bathrooms boast double basins &amp; showers.
The long wooden deck offers spectacular views of the ocean.  It is here where guests enjoy a meal, watch the sunset with a cocktail in hand, or unwind in the jacuzzi with a glass of bubbly.  
Deep sofas &amp; comfortable chairs in the lounge invite you to relax after dinner.  The lodge is also home to a cocktail bar &amp; wine cellar that offers an extensive range of local wines.

#### Activities
At Tintswalo Atlantic, dining is a much-deserved treat.  Chefs are more than happy to cook according to your taste as all meals are catered to your needs &amp; preferences.  Dinner can be served in the dining room or kitchen, outside on the deck or in the privacy of your suite.
