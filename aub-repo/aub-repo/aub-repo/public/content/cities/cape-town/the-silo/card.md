## Cape Town
### The Silo

#### Experience
Architectural imagination turned what was once the elevator portion of a historic grain silo complex into one of Cape Town’s most magnificent luxury hotels.  
The Silo sits above the Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa, which aims to have the largest collection of modern African art in the world &amp; hotel guests will have direct access to this artistic slice of paradise.  The V&amp;A Waterfront with its boutique shops, cafes &amp; restaurants is within walking distance.
The hotel is constructed from glass panels &amp; steel &amp; at night, is transformed into a glowing beacon in the working harbour.
Captivating views of Table Mountain &amp; Signal Hill confirms that Cape Town is, without a doubt, South Africa’s most beautiful city.

#### Stay
The Silo offers a personalized boutique hotel experience &amp; with only 28 individually styled rooms &amp; suites, guests will receive all the attention they deserve.
Rooms range from standard rooms to royal suites, as well as an elegant penthouse with triple aspect views of Table Mountain, the harbour &amp; the Atlantic Ocean.
The hotel features a rooftop swimming pool, a wellness spa &amp; a fitness centre as well as a cosy library, bar &amp; restaurant serving superb fine dining cuisine.

#### Activities
There is a never-ending list of things to do in Cape Town – from visiting Clifton &amp; Camps Bay beaches, shopping at the V&amp;A Waterfront &amp; wine-tasting in the Cape Winelands to spending time with the adorable penguins at Boulders Beach or having a picnic in Kirstenbosch Gardens.
Other options like shark-cage diving or whale watching can also be arranged.
