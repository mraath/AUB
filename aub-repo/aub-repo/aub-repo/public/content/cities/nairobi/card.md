## CITIES
### Nairobi

#### Experience
Nairobi, Kenya’s capital, is bigger than Johannesburg &amp; after decades of regular international flights, have become the unrivalled gateway to East Africa.
This vibrant city is an ideal pit-stop for safari-goers who want to recover from jetlag before their Kenya safari, or who need an overnight stay to catch a connecting flight.
Nairobi offers a wide selection of accommodation options for guests – from larger sky-scraper type hotels to smaller boutique hotels &amp; safari-style lodges in the nearby Nairobi National Park.
A family favourite – The Giraffe Manor - is based in Nairobi, along with the world-renowned Carnivore Restaurant that serves some of the best steak dinners on Planet Earth. These are just two of the best places to visit in Nairobi. 
Home to 2 airports – Nairobi Jomo Kenyatta International Airport where international flights land &amp; Wilson Airport (a 30min drive away) that offers flights in smaller aircraft to Kenya’s wildlife reserves.

#### Activities
Apart from eating wonderful steak dinners at Carnivore Restaurant in Nairobi, this vibrant city offers a variety of exciting attractions &amp; activities.
If you’re after cultural experiences in Nairobi, guests can visit the Karen Blixen Museum, the Daphne Sheldrick Elephant Orphanage or even the nearby Nairobi National Park for a quick safari fix before heading out to the more famous wildlife reserves in Kenya.

#### When to travel
The best time to plan your Nairobi tour activities is during the dry months of July through October &amp; also January &amp; February.
July welcomes the lowest rainfall month of the year, just less than one inch of water. The driest and coolest months in Nairobi are July and August.
However, Nairobi is usually a pit stop before a Kenya safari &amp; guests should therefore rather plan their trip accordingly.
