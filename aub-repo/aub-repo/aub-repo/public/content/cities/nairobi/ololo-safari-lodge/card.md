### Ololo Safari Lodge

#### Experience
Nairobi National Park is the only park in the world that borders a capital city &amp; on its border lies Ololo Safari Lodge, a classic safari haven set in 20 acres of lush gardens.
Its ideal setting within 45 minutes from Jomo Kenyatta International Airport &amp; its convenient access through the park makes this an ideal choice for travellers who would like to start their safari on the first day they arrive in Kenya.
Uninterrupted views can be enjoyed from the comfort of the lodge’s spacious verandas &amp; the surrounding gardens provide shelter for many of the 500 bird species of the national park.
Four of the Big 5 members can frequently be spotted from Ololo’s main terrace. (there are no elephants here)

#### Stay
There are a variety of room types at Ololo, including 7 stable rooms, 3 tented cottages, 2 suites &amp; 1 three-bedroom stable cottage that is ideal for families.
The stable rooms were once original stone-built horse stables, now all equipped with new bathrooms &amp; traditional stable doors.
Nestled on the edge of the park are the tented cottages with Makuti roofs &amp; partial canvas, offering guests a safari-style experience.  
The suites have traditional living areas with open fireplaces &amp; French doors opening to private terraces with views of the garden &amp; park.
Perfect for families, the 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom cottage which was part of the original stable building, has been converted to a lovely light-filled space.  The open plan cottage &amp; features a small kitchen &amp; terrace with a breathtaking view of the park.

#### Activities
Guests staying at Ololo Safari Lodge can enjoy open 4x4 game drives, sundowner excursions, bush breakfasts in the park or day tours into the city.
