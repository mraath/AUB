### The Elephant Camp

#### Experience
The Elephant Camp is located within in a private concession, a short drive from the magnificent Victoria Falls on the Zimbabwean side of the Zambezi River.
The camp overlooks a waterhole that is fed by natural streams in the rainy season that rush down to meet the Masuwe River &amp; the Zambezi gorges below the Falls. 
Breathtaking views of the Victoria Falls’ spray can be enjoyed from the camp’s viewing deck.  This luxury &amp; intimate lodge under canvas is within easy reach of Victoria Falls, yet secluded in its own private game reserve where close-up encounters with wildlife can be enjoyed.
