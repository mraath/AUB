## CITIES
### Durban

#### Experience
The friendly city of Durban lies at the heart of the east coast &amp; is a wonderful springboard from which to access KwaZulu-Natal’s most popular destinations, including the Drakensberg, iSimangaliso Wetland Park &amp; Phinda Game Reserve.
The multi-cultural city with its large Indian &amp; Zulu populations is home to warm water beaches, high-rise hotels &amp; the world’s 5th largest aquarium: Ushaka Marine World and so many other things to see and do.
Durban has a wide selection of bars &amp; restaurants, offering a diverse menu that will suit every palate. Here you can enjoy the best Indian curries in South Africa, seafood fresh from the ocean &amp; the ever-popular bunny chow – a South African fast food dish consisting of a hollowed-out loaf of white bread filled with curry.
Unlike many of South Africa’s other beach destinations, Durban boasts warm water – so swimmers &amp; surfers are likely to spend much of their beach time immersed in the Indian Ocean.

#### Activities
The Golden Mile is one of the top attractions in Durban, &amp; as such, is certainly worth exploring. As its name implies, this beachfront promenade boasts a gorgeous stretch of several golden beaches &amp; on your doorstep you will find some of Durban’s best restaurants, shops &amp; cultural attractions.
Ushaka Marine World – the world’s 5th largest aquarium should certainly be added to your list of activities. Marvel at the underwater world &amp; all its interesting creatures, get wet at the waterpark, enjoy thrilling animal encounters or challenge yourself at the rope adventure park.
Other popular Durban activities include taking a stroll through the botanical gardens or shopping at Victoria Street Market with its wide selection of African artwork, Indian spices, food &amp; traditional clothes.

#### When to travel
Durban enjoys warm weather year-round. Summer is between November to April when the city experiences its rainy season - but days are warm &amp; humid with average temperatures around 28 degrees Celsius.
Our best Durban travel recommendation is that for many people, Durban is the perfect winter destination. It is still warm from May to October, with the average temperature around 23 degrees Celsius, even in the coldest parts of the year.
