### The Spa House

#### Experience
The Spa House is an exclusive private villa set in leafy Hout Bay of the Cape Peninsula’s Atlantic seaboard.
This award-winning villa with avant-garde eco-design offers the perfect blend between marble, glass &amp; timber to maximize its captivating mountain &amp; forest views.
It is the ultimate mountainside retreat with a picture-perfect setting.  Located only a 20-minute drive from the glittering lights of Cape Town, The Spa House offers a secluded haven away from the hustle &amp; bustle of city life – yet still close enough to explore Table Mountain, the V&amp;A Waterfront or one of Cape Town’s blue flag beaches.  
On your doorstep, you will find attractions such as Chapman’s Peak Drive &amp; the beautiful Constantia Wine Route.  Their on-site wellness spa features a salt bath, sauna, steam room &amp; indoor jacuzzi, so guests are invited to put up their feet &amp; get pampered after a day of city exploration.

#### Stay
Built over several levels to provide complete privacy, this 3-bedroom villa has a heated, 3m deep infinity pool.  The lower level houses the underground ‘underwater’ spa, which has large windows to the pool that allows a mesmerizing view of passing swimmers
Each of the 3 bedrooms has an elegant en-suite bathroom &amp; beautiful views. 
There is also an open-plan living &amp; dining area complete with a wooden deck &amp; relaxing sun loungers.  The Spa House is surrounded by lush indigenous vegetation, manicured gardens &amp; gorgeous views of the mountain &amp; valley.  In addition to the giant outdoor extra deep swimming pool, kids also have their own pool.

#### Activities
There is a never-ending list of things to do in Cape Town – from visiting Clifton &amp; Camps Bay beaches, shopping at the V&amp;A Waterfront &amp; wine-tasting in the Cape Winelands to spending time with the adorable penguins at Boulders Beach or having a picnic in Kirstenbosch Gardens.
Other options like shark-cage diving or whale watching can also be arranged.
