### More Quarters

#### Experience
More Quarters offers their guests exactly that….More.  
More space, more luxury &amp; more personal service. Operating exactly like a hotel, guests will still enjoy the benefits of a hotel – including concierge, breakfast, daily cleaning &amp; personal attention, while enjoying extra comforts like space &amp; privacy.
More Quarters is ideal for families, groups or couples interested in a little bit more.  Guests will be able to choose between one &amp; two-bedroom apartments as well as a three-bedroom villa, all set within a quiet haven close to the trendy Kloof Street.
More Quarters is located at the foot of majestic Table Mountain, within walking distance of restaurants, shops &amp; boutiques to ensure a comfortable stay for guests who desire a measure of independence during their Cape Town holiday.

#### Stay
All luxury apartments consist of spacious living areas &amp; modern, comfortable furnishings – offering a home-away-from-home feel.  Breakfast can be enjoyed at the hotel or in the comfort of your apartment.
The apartments all boast modern conveniences, such as air-conditioning, internet access, minibars &amp; secure parking.  
Guests can relax in the hotel’s elegant lounge while the concierge arranges day trips, transfers, restaurant reservations &amp; spa treatments.

#### Activities
Cape Town is without a doubt, South Africa’s most remarkable city.  
There is a never-ending list of things to do here – from visiting Cape Town’s best beaches, shopping at the V&amp;A Waterfront &amp; wine-tasting in the Cape Winelands to spending time with the adorable penguins at Boulders Beach or having a picnic in Kirstenbosch Gardens.
Other options like shark-cage diving or whale watching can also be arranged.
