## South Africa
### Welgevonden Game Reserve

#### Experience
Welgevonden Game Reserve is a 36,000-hectare private game reserve in the Waterberg District of the Limpopo Province of South Africa.
The reserve is one of the most accessible premier malaria-free wilderness reserves in the country. After a pleasant 2.5-hour drive (or an easy 45-minute flight) from Johannesburg, guests will arrive in Big 5 territory.
Here, lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo, &amp rhino roam freely – along with an abundance of other wildlife &amp a colorful collection of birds. The rare and unusual species like cheetah, brown hyena, caracal, aardwolf, &amp aardvark can also be seen here.
Welgevonden offers an exclusive, intimate safari experience, with only a limited number of guests having access to the reserve at any one time. Because of this vehicle restriction &amp the fact that the animals have never been hunted means that they remain largely unphased by human proximity, allowing for particularly close-up encounters.

#### Activities
At Welgevonden, guests will have the opportunity to see over 65 mammal species – including the coveted Big 5 as well as over 300 species of bird!
Visitors can observe Africa’s magnificent creatures in the wild with twice-daily open 4x4 game drives &amp nature walks with expert-led guides. Game drives take place twice daily - once in the morning &amp once in the afternoon &amp evening so that guests have an opportunity to search for nocturnal animals with a spotlight.

#### When to travel
Welgevonden’s climate is generally described as warm and temperate, with three distinct seasons.
The dryer winter months (May – July) are often considered the best time of year for big game viewing as the grass &amp savanna are shorter and less dense than in the wetter months, making the animals easier to spot.
From August to October, the bush remains predominantly dry, though you will get the occasional thunderstorm rolling in across the plains. The wet season is from November to April. These wetter months are the best time to enjoy the region’s incredible array of birdlife.
