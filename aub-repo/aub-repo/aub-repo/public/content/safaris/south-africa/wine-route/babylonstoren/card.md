## Wine Route
### Babylonstoren

#### Experience
The picturesque valleys of the Wine Route (also referred to as the Cape Winelands) are renowned for their exquisite wines, grand old estates, pretty towns, &amp award-winning restaurants.
Within only a 60-minute drive from vibrant Cape Town, you reach one of the most breathtaking regions in South Africa where Alpine-style views, art galleries, &amp quaint side-walk cafes are seen from almost every street.
The Cape Winelands generally refers to the three most popular wine-growing regions surrounding Cape Town: Franschhoek, Stellenbosch, &amp Paarl, each countryside setting as beautiful as the next.
Franschhoek is South Africa’s gourmet capital, so guests here can take their pick from a wide selection of award-winning restaurants. The oak tree-lined streets of Stellenbosch are dotted with art galleries, quaint coffee shops, boutiques, and side-walk cafes while the quiet town of Paarl provides a relaxing, off-the-beaten-track Winelands experience.
The Wine Route is home to a variety of accommodation options that suit every type of traveler – from luxurious manor houses &amp secluded boutique hotels to farm-style suites &amp family-friendly villas.

#### Stay
Small &amp; intimate, Babylonstoren only consists of 22 cottages &amp; suites to ensure a private, exclusive stay.  There are 6 one-bedroom suites, 3 one-bedroom cottages, 4 two-bedroom cottages &amp; 9 farmhouse suites. 
The suites &amp; cottages are built in traditional Cape Dutch style, with white-washed walls, thatched roofs &amp; clean, contemporary interiors.  High ceilings, white decor &amp; hand-picked furniture give the rooms a modern feel while maintaining the historical flair.
The tea garden provides delicious lunches, while the renowned Babel restaurant remains a favourite for its interesting food combinations.  Other areas include a gym, library, bar, wellness spa &amp; swimming pool.

#### Activities
Foodies and wine lovers should – most definitely – add the Winelands to their bucket list! But this breathtaking region offers so much more than just food &amp wine. Guests can enjoy a long list of activities, including mountain biking, quad biking, hiking, &amp horse-riding. Other attractions include art galleries, museums, wellness spas, &amp shopping.
Families will be spoiled for choice in the Winelands. Fun family-friendly activities include animal encounters, grape juice &amp chocolate tastings, wine farm picnics, strawberry picking, acrobranching (treetop obstacle courses), &amp even eco-friendly, non-motorized scooter rides through the vineyards – great fun for the whole family. Some wine farms also offer authentic outdoor farm experiences specifically designed for the little ones.

#### When to travel
The best time to visit the Winelands is between October &amp April when days are warm, dry, &amp sunny. Winter is between June &amp August, but foodies can still enjoy rainy days next to a cosy fire.
