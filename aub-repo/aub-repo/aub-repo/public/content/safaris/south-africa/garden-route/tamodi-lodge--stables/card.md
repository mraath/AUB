### Tamodi Lodge & Stables

#### Experience
Tamodi Lodge enjoys an idyllic setting on a working equestrian farm within a private nature reserve just outside the sought-after seaside town of Plettenberg Bay.
Here, guests will enjoy jaw-dropping views of the surrounding mountains in a serene setting.  
Just around the corner &amp; a short drive away, you will find Plettenberg Bay with its blue flag beaches &amp; a long list of activities, including seasonal whale watching, water sports, golf &amp; wine tasting.
The area is particularly good for hiking &amp; mountain biking, so nature-lovers will feel like they are in paradise.
Since the lodge only has 7 rooms, it can be booked on an exclusive-use basis, making this a wonderful Garden Route retreat for families, couples or friends travelling together.

#### Stay
Tamodi comprises 7 luxury suites, each designed around a grand main house with a swimming pool.  Each suite has an en-suite bathroom with a separate bath &amp; shower as well as an outdoor deck with seating, offering unspoilt views over the valley below the lodge.
Some suites also offer outdoor showers &amp; private plunge pools – the ideal place to unwind after a day out exploring the Garden Route.
The main area includes 2 spacious lounges, a bar, a cosy library &amp; a sparkling swimming pool.

#### Activities
The Garden Route’s list of activities is endless.  These include horse-riding, quad biking, mountain biking, tennis, spa treatments &amp; deep-sea fishing. 
Other exciting options include forest hikes, elephant-back rides, tree-canopy tours, birding, whale watching &amp; much more.
Beach-lovers will enjoy spending time at one of Plettenberg Bay’s blue flag beaches.
At Tamodi, there is a guided hiking trail &amp; 2 bird-watching decks on the farm.  Mountain biking is on offer close by.
