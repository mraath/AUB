### Leisure Isle Lodge

#### Experience
Situated on a tiny island in Knysna Lagoon, right at the heart of the Garden Route, you will find Leisure Isle Lodge – a charming guesthouse that sits alongside cosy beach cottages.
Offering beautiful views of the Knysna Lagoon, the elegant restaurant &amp; outdoor pool area is a wonderful place to relax in the sun after a day of exploration.
This intimate guesthouse offers great service, along with a friendly home-away-from-home atmosphere that attracts couples, friends &amp; families alike.
Just across the road, you will find a lovely little stretch of beach – a serene slice of paradise that welcomes guests to stroll along its soft, powdery sand or take a refreshing dip in the warm, lagoon.

#### Stay
Small &amp; intimate, Leisure Isle Lodge only offers 10 rooms &amp; a penthouse, each equipped with air-conditioning &amp; an en-suite bathroom.
The rooms consist of garden or lagoon facing rooms, each beautifully decorated.  The penthouse boasts a private balcony overlooking the lagoon, a lounge &amp; dining area with a fireplace as well as an open patio with lagoon views.
Leisure Isle Lodge has a lovely private swimming pool &amp; a wellness spa as well as a stylish lounge &amp; bar area that looks out over the Knysna Lagoon.  Their award-winning Daniela’s Restaurant is positioned overlooking Bollard Bay &amp; the lagoon.

#### Activities
Knysna offers a variety of fun-filled Garden Route activities.  Some of these include boating, canoeing, fishing, hiking or romantic sunset cruises.  Other exciting options include waterskiing, motorized water sports, kite surfing &amp; mountain bike trips.  Golf &amp; shopping excursions to nearby markets are also popular pastimes. 
Guests can also do a day trip to Plettenberg Bay to visit the Elephant Sanctuary or go zip lining through the forest.  Ferry rides to the nearby Featherbed Nature Reserve with its ancient caves &amp; sandy coves should also be added to the list.  And visits to the famous Knysna Heads are a must.
