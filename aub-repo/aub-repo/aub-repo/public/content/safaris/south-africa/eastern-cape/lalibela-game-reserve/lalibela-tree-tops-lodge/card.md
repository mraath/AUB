### Lalibela Tree Tops Lodge

#### Experience
Lalibela Game Reserve in the Eastern Cape consists of 7,500 hectares of land &amp; is home to Africa’s Big 5 – lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo &amp; rhino.  
Only an hour away from Port Elizabeth &amp; Addo Elephant Park, Lalibela is the perfect safari getaway for guests visiting the Garden Route on a self-drive holiday.

#### Stay
Lalibela Tree Tops Lodge boasts 5 luxury safari tents perched high on thatched platforms at “tree top” level &amp; are joined by raised walkways.  Beautiful views can be enjoyed from these treehouse-like tents.
The tents have canvas walls &amp; thatched roofs with huge window areas &amp; private verandas, so guests can truly enjoy the ‘bird’s eye view’ from their rooms.
The main area includes a large lounge, bar &amp; open-air dining deck with a view over a waterhole.  Guests can also cool off in the swimming pool after a day out in the bush.

#### Activities
Guests visiting Lalibela can expect to see a variety of game during their time on safari.  Twice daily game drives in open 4x4 vehicles will ensure excellent photographic opportunities &amp; close wildlife encounters.  
Daily walking safaris are a fun &amp; exciting way of getting closer to nature.  Guests can also learn how to track animals on foot - a true adventure.
