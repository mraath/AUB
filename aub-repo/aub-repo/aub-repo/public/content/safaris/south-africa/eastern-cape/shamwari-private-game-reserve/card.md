### Shamwari Private Game Reserve

#### Experience
Shamwari Private Game Reserve is a luxury wildlife destination located within South Africa’s culturally significant Eastern Cape &amp; places a strong emphasis on conservation &amp; eco-tourism.
Meaning ‘my friend’ in Shona, Shamwari is arguably one of the best malaria-free safari destinations in the country &amp; is home to the coveted Big 5 – lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo &amp; rhino as well as an abundance of other wildlife, such as hippo, giraffe, cheetah &amp; zebra.
At the pinnacle of private game reserves, the 25,000-hectare Shamwari wilderness never fails to impress when it comes to big game, excellent guides &amp; luxurious lodges.
Shamwari has 7 lodges &amp; 1 explorer camp, offering a wide selection of safari lodges &amp; tented camps for couples, honeymooners, families &amp; friends.
Shamwari Private Game Reserve offers a range of activities specifically designed for children which, added to its accessibility from Port Elizabeth or the Garden Route as well as its malaria-free status, make it a popular safari choice for families.

#### Activities
Shamwari’s diverse wilderness area makes Big 5 game viewing easy.  The reserve is home to lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo &amp; rhino as well as plenty of plains game &amp; over 200 varieties of raptors &amp; birds.
Daily safari drives are conducted in open 4x4 vehicles.  Professional rangers will take you on a journey through the bushveld &amp; ensure close encounters with South Africa’s wildlife.  Nature walks, spa treatments &amp; photographic courses can also be arranged.
Guests staying at Shwamwari can also get involved in the Wildlife Rehabilitation Programme or the Born Free Big Cat Sanctuary where the focus is on conservation.

#### When to travel
The best wildlife viewing is during the driest winter months of June to September.  
However, it can be very cold during this time of the year, &amp; warm winter clothing is essential, particularly for taking part in nighttime and early morning game drives in open vehicles.
The summer months between October &amp; May bring warmer weather.
