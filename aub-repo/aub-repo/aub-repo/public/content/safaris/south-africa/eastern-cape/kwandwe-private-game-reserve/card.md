## Eastern Cape
### Kwandwe Private Game Reserve

#### Experience
Nestled in the heart of South Africa’s unspoilt Eastern Cape province lies a world-class Big 5 safari destination:  Kwandwe Private Game Reserve.
Within this pristine, 22,000-hectare wilderness that stretches from either side of the Great Fish River - which meanders for 30km through the scenic landscape, you will find just 30 rooms split across 6 individual safari lodges, affording it one of the highest land-to-guest ratios in South Africa.
Moreover, Kwandwe is a malaria-free region that is known for its abundance of wildlife, quality guiding &amp; understated luxury.
With its accessible location (less than a 2-hour drive from Port Elizabeth), breathtaking scenery and Big 5 game viewing, Kwandwe Private Game Reserve is the perfect safari add-on to a trip along South Africa’s world-famous Garden Route.

#### Activities
Kwandwe offers a variety of exciting safari activities.
These include open 4x4 game drives in search of big game as well as expert-led walking safaris.  Other exciting activities include bird watching, fishing, picnics, rock art expeditions &amp; cultural tours.  
Game drives include morning &amp; night drives where guests will search for nocturnal animals with spotlight – quite the adventure!
Some family-friendly lodges also offer Kids Clubs where the little ones will be entertained with a wide selection of fun-filled games, crafts &amp; safari activities.

#### When to travel
Kwandwe’s wildlife viewing is favourable all year but is marginally best in the driest months of the year (June through September). 
This is during the winter season, so it can become very cold at times.  It is important to prepare for this with warm clothing, which is particularly important for evening &amp; morning game drives in open vehicles.
The warmer summer months (October to April) are more pleasant.
