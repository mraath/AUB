# Nottens Bush Camp
## Sabi Sand Private Game Reserve
### Nottens Bush Camp

#### Experience
Notten’s Bush Camp is a hidden gem set in the heart of the Sabi Sand Game Reserve &amp; shares an unfenced border with the Kruger National Park.
Notten’s is an exclusive &amp; private safari lodge personally owned &amp; run by the Notten family.  They treat each guest like a member of the family &amp; offers relaxed, yet personalized service.

#### Stay
Each of the 9 private suites is equipped with an en-suite bathroom with a bath, indoor &amp; outdoor shower.  Paraffin lamps and candles replace electric lighting for ambience and all the rooms are cooled with air-conditioning. 
The camp features a comfortable lounge area with a large deck overlooking a waterhole as well as a dining area, 20-metre lap pool, spa &amp; open-air boma.  Due to the lack of electricity in the suites, the main area is where you charge your camera.

#### Activities
The Southern section of the Sabi Sand Reserve is famous for its many predator sightings, so guests can enjoy close encounters with these wonderful species from open 4x4 safari vehicles or guided bush walks.
Relaxing massage treatments at the nature spa can also be arranged at an additional cost.
