### Thornybush Private Game Reserve

#### Experience
Thornybush Private Game Reserve is a leading destination in the Greater Kruger Park area &amp; is home to the coveted Big 5 – lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo &amp; rhino – as well as an abundance of other wildlife.
The reserve boasts a variety of community-based conservation projects with the Moholoholo Rehabilitation Centre &amp; Cheetah Breeding Project, giving guests deeper insight into their efforts to protect the environment.  
The Thornybush Reserve has also been one of the first reserves in the Lowveld to start rhino-horn treatments to combat poaching &amp; has been the chosen setting of many wildlife documentaries.
Thornybush is easily accessed via Hoedspruit Airport &amp; consists of a wide selection of safari lodges that are suited to all types of travellers – from honeymooners &amp; couples to friends &amp; families.
Unlike the National Park, off-road driving &amp; night drives are permitted in the Thornybush Reserve, so here, safari enthusiasts can expect fantastic, close-up wildlife encounters.

#### Activities
Visitors get the opportunity to observe Africa’s magnificent creatures in the wild with twice-daily open 4x4 game drives &amp; nature walks with expert-led guides.  
Game drives take place twice daily - once in the morning &amp; once in the afternoon &amp; evening so that guests have an opportunity to search for nocturnal animals with a spotlight.
Off-road driving will take you straight into the action &amp; ensure wildlife encounters of the highest standard.

#### When to travel
Winter (May to September, also known as the dry season) is the best time for wildlife viewing throughout the region.  Vegetation thins during this time, so wildlife spotting is easy.
April &amp; October are considered shoulder months &amp; are also good for game viewing.  During the rainy season, December to March – the bush is lush &amp; it turns into a birder’s paradise.
