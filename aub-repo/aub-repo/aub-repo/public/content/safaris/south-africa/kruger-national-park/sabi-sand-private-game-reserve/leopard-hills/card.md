# Leopard Hills
## Sabi Sand Private Game Reserve
### Leopard Hills

#### Experience
Leopard Hills is set on a hill overlooking a natural waterhole within the wildlife-rich Sabi Sand Reserve &amp; bordering South Africa’s famed Kruger National Park.  This luxurious lodge provides jaw-dropping views over the African bush.
This southern section of the Sabi Sand Private Game Reserve is “Big 5 Paradise.” The lodge’s prime waterhole location is fantastic because animals often make their way here for a drink.  Guests can enjoy front-row game viewing from the comfort of the lodge’s viewing deck.

#### Stay
Leopard Hills features 8 luxurious glass-fronted suites, complete with private plunge pools &amp; en-suite bathrooms.  The views from the rooms are spectacular, especially from the outdoor shower on the sun deck.  
The main lodge consists of an expansive wooden deck, the perfect place to enjoy lunch with a pair of binoculars at hand, as you can scan the bush below for wildlife.  There is also a comfortable sitting area with a bar &amp; a well-stocked library where lazy afternoons can be spent reading up on local literature.

#### Activities
Guests can experience the beauty of the Sabi Sand on early morning &amp; afternoon game drives.  Guided walking safaris are also offered for those who would like to get a little closer to nature.
Leopard Hills also offers a luxurious spa &amp; an open-air boma where al fresco dinners are served under the stars.  For guests who are interested in photography, please ask your ranger for some tips as many of them are avid fans of photography themselves.
