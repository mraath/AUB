## Kruger Private Concession
### Hamiltons Tented Camp

#### Experience
Situated within a private concession in the world-renowned Kruger National Park, Hamiltons Tented Camp takes you back to an era where grace &amp; style were the epitome of luxurious living. 
Named after Colonel Stephenson Hamilton who was instrumental in establishing the world-renowned Kruger National Park, Hamiltons Tented Camp offers guests a luxurious safari adventure in a remote &amp; pristine bush setting.

#### Stay
Hamiltons consists of 6 beautifully decorated tents, each equipped with an antique-styled bath &amp; outdoor shower.  Each tent features a private viewing deck that looks out over the unspoiled bush.  From your private deck, you can enjoy the sights and sounds of the bush that derives its existence from the river.
The main lodge features a comfortable lounge, indoor &amp; outdoor dining areas as well as a sparkling swimming pool where guests can cool off after a day out in the bush.

#### Activities
The Kruger National Park is famous for its superb Big 5 game viewing &amp; knowledgeable guides.  Here at Hamiltons Tented Camp, twice daily morning &amp; afternoon game drives are conducted in open 4x4 safari vehicles, ensuring close encounters &amp; wonderful photographic opportunities.
Guided nature walks are offered after breakfast each day.  For those wishing to get closer to nature, this remains a highlight.  
Lazy afternoons can also be spent next to the swimming pool with a cocktail in hand or on the wooden deck overlooking the bushveld where animals often wander by.
