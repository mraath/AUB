### Boabab Ridge

#### Experience
Boabab Ridge lies within the Klaserie Private Nature Reserve in the Greater Kruger region &amp; offers guests a luxurious &amp; authentic wilderness experience.
The lodge is family-owned &amp; run, so provides guests with a relaxed home-away-from-home safari experience.
As part of the Greater Kruger, the Klaserie has no fences between it &amp; the Kruger National Park &amp; is therefore proud to offer visitors a phenomenal Big 5 safari experience.

#### Stay
There are 7 freestanding suites in total.  All suites are raised on timber decks, allowing beautiful views over the bush.  
Six of these suites are superior suites, each open-plan in design, featuring an en-suite bathroom with bathtub as well as indoor &amp; outdoor showers.  Each suite also has an outdoor seating area with bush views.
There is also 1 family suite. located furthest away from the main building.  This suite is similar in style to the superior suites, except that it houses 2 smaller en-suite bedrooms so that 2 adults &amp; 2 children can comfortably stay together.  
The main lodge area features a bar, lounge, TV room, outdoor terrace, dining room, open-air boma &amp; swimming pool overlooking a waterhole.
