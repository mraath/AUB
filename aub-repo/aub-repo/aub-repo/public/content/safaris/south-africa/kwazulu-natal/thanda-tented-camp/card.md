### Thanda Tented Camp

#### Experience
Thanda, meaning ‘love’ in Zulu, is a celebration of Zulu people &amp; their rich culture.  With an excellent location on the Elephant Coast in Kwazulu Natal, Thanda Private Game Reserve provides fantastic Big 5 game viewing in a remote &amp; pristine setting.
Thanda Tented Camp enjoys a beautiful location on a hill, offering spectacular views of the bushveld.  
Guests staying here will encounter an authentic tented safari experience in a relaxed bushveld setting.  Tod add to the genuine bush atmosphere, the camp is non-electrified – so paraffin lanterns provide a magical feeling at night. (Solar &amp; backup generators are used to charge cameras &amp; phones.)

#### Stay
Thanda allows you to enjoy an authentic bush experience, without compromising on luxury or service.  There are 14 luxury tents &amp; 1 honeymoon tent, each equipped with a viewing deck, spacious bathroom &amp; shower.
The main area includes a Hemingway-style lounge, dining room, large rim-flow pool surrounded by loungers &amp; umbrellas as well as a waterhole where plenty of animal activity takes place.

#### Activities
Activities at Thanda Private Game Reserve include exciting game drives in open 4x4 safari vehicles, guided walking safaris where guests can explore the bush on foot as well as boat trips on the St. Lucia estuary.
Guests can also enjoy diving, fishing, beach horse riding, Zulu cultural experiences &amp; whale watching in season.
