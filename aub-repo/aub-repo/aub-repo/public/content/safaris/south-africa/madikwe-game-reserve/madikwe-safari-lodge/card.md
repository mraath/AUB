#### Experience
Deep in the heart of Madikwe Private Game Reserve lies the famous Madikwe Safari Lodge, a luxurious family-friendly bushveld retreat.
Offering sweeping views over the game-filled plains &amp; Waterberg mountains, Madikwe Safari Lodge consists of 3 separate safari camps: Lelapo (12 suites) - geared towards families, Kopano (4 suites) – ideal for couples &amp; Dhitaba (4 suites) – for guests in need of absolute privacy.

#### Stay
These 3 separate camps at Madikwe Safari Lodge offer a total of 20 suites, each featuring a bedroom, sitting area, fireplace, en-suite bathroom, private deck &amp; plunge pool.  Here guests can relax on comfortable sun chairs, take a dip in the pool or enjoy a book with a cocktail in hand.
Intimate sitting areas in all 3 camps feature cosy sofas, shaded outdoor seating &amp; bean bags for casual relaxation.  Spectacular views can be enjoyed from the dining room &amp; lounge areas.
Children of all ages are allowed at Lelapo - Madikwe Safari Lodge’s family camp.  Specialized activities will keep them active &amp; teach them about the wild.  Kopano is an adult-only camp &amp; Dhitaba only allows children if booked exclusively.

#### Activities
Twice daily game drives in open 4x4 safari vehicles will ensure close encounters with Africa’s Big 5.  Should guests feel adventurous, they can also enjoy guided bush walks &amp; track down some of the smaller animals &amp; birds.
After a sundowner stop in the bush, the nocturnal search begins.  Guests will have the opportunity to look for some of these rarer species with a spotlight.
