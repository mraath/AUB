#### Experience
Set within the 75,000 hectares Madikwe Private Game Reserve in the North West Province of South Africa, Madikwe Hills Private Game Lodge provides an authentic safari experience in a pristine bush setting.
The reserve is home to Africa’s Big 5 – lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo &amp; rhino – so guests visiting Madikwe Hills can expect good quality game viewing throughout the year.

#### Stay
Madikwe Hills Game Lodge consists of a Main Lodge with 10 suites &amp; a private camp, Little Madikwe Hills consisting of a 2-bedroom suite with a private ranger, butler &amp; vehicle.  A gourmet kitchen &amp; entertainment centre complete the picture. 
The glass-fronted suites at Madikwe Hills Game Lodge are complete with a secluded verandah &amp; plunge pool to ensure absolute privacy.  Each suite features an outdoor shower, romantic bathroom &amp; viewing deck with unobstructed views over the reserve.  
The main area features a comfortable lounge, dining area, library &amp; swimming pool.

#### Activities
Daily game drives are conducted in open 4x4 safari vehicles.  Close animal sightings can be expected, so it is recommended to bring a good camera to snap away at some of nature’s wildest animals.
Guests can also visit the nearby local village &amp; meet members from the Molatedi community.
