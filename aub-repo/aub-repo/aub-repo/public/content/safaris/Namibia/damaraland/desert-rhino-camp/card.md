### Desert Rhino Camp

#### Experience
Desert Rhino Camp lies in the 450,000 hectares Palmwag Concession in Namibia's Damaraland.  
This region is marked for its tranquil, minimalist beauty, wealth of desert-adapted wildlife &amp; the largest free-roaming black rhino population in Africa.
Desert Rhino Camp enjoys magnificent views of the surrounding Etendeka Mountains.

#### Stay
Accommodation at Desert Rhino Camp consists of 8 Meru-style canvas tents that sleep a maximum of 16 guests.  
Each tent has been raised from the ground on a wooden deck &amp; features an en-suite bathroom with a shower.  
The main lodge area features a tented lounge &amp; dining room, also raised on a wooden deck – offering panoramic views through the tent's partially open sides.  
Dinners can be enjoyed al fresco around the firepit or on the deck.

#### Activities
Like the name suggests, activities at Desert Rhino Camp include rhino tracking adventures on foot &amp; by vehicle.  The camp has some of the most knowledgeable guides in Namibia. 
Other species found in this area include healthy populations of desert-adapted elephants, mountain zebra, giraffe, gemsbok, springbok, kudu &amp; predators such as lion, cheetah, leopard, brown &amp; spotted hyena &amp; a diverse range of birds.
Game drives, guided nature walks &amp; picnic lunches in the desert are also popular.
