#### Experience
Ongava Tented Camp is one of Namibia’s hidden gems.  Located in the Ongava Game Reserve to the south of the Etosha National Park, it overlooks a nearby waterhole.
Similar in size to Switzerland, The Etosha National Park is one of Africa’s largest game reserves &amp; is famous for its excellent waterhole game viewing.

#### Stay
Ongava Tented Camp consists of 8 spacious Meru-style tents, all with en-suite bathrooms, open-air showers &amp; private verandahs looking out over the reserve.  
One of these tents is a 2-bedroom family unit that can sleep 4 guests &amp; also comes with en-suite bathrooms.
The main lodge features a relaxing bar, swimming pool &amp; deck area where guests can watch the wildlife quench their thirst at the nearby waterhole.

#### Activities
At Ongava Tented Camp, activities revolve around day &amp; night game drives, visiting hides that overlook waterholes &amp; guided nature walks with experienced guides.
