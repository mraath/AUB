### Sossus Dune Lodge

#### Experience
The eco-friendly Sossus Dune Lodge is set at the base of a mountain inside the Namib Naukluft National Park in Namibia.
With easy access to the Sossusvlei &amp; Sesriem Canyon, the lodge provides a wonderful base from which to explore the Namib Desert.
This region is probably the most popular destination in Namibia.  Red sand dunes, hot-air balloon safaris, beautiful landscapes &amp; excellent photographic opportunities all contribute to Sossusvlei’s claim to fame.

#### Stay
Sossus Dune Lodge comprises 25 chalets – 13 with dune views &amp; 12 with mountain &amp; canyon views.
Each chalet features an en-suite bathroom, floor-to-ceiling front glass windows &amp; fantastic desert views.  
The central areas of the lodge are raised on wooden decks &amp; include an open-plain dining room &amp; lounge, an elegant bar &amp; a sparkling swimming pool.

#### Activities
Activities at Sossus Dune Lodge revolve around Sossusvlei day &amp; sunset drives, guided nature walks &amp; trips to Dead Vlei, a popular clay pan.
The Sossusvlei dunes are among the highest in the world, with the highest being the Big Daddy, about 380 meters high.  Dune 45 lies 45km past Sesriem on the road to Sossusvlei &amp; is known as “the most photographed dune in the world” because of its unusually simple &amp; fascinating shape.  Trips to photograph these amazing dunes are often a highlight.
Stargazing is also a wonderful evening activity that can be enjoyed.
