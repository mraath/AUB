## Skeleton Coast
### Shipwreck Lodge

#### Experience
Skeleton Coast National Park, named after the old shipwrecks that litter this stretch of Africa, is a mysterious &amp; remote region in Namibia where enormous sand dunes &amp; the roaring Atlantic Ocean meet.
Here you will find Skeleton Coast Camp – the only camp situated in the national park &amp; home to the desert-dwelling elephants as well as the elusive desert-adapted lion &amp; brown hyena.
With nearly 250 species of birdlife &amp; the oldest (&amp; strangest) desert plant on earth, the Skeleton Coast offers a truly peculiar &amp; off-the-beaten-track safari experience.

#### Stay
There are only 10 unusual &amp; innovative cabins that have been constructed to resemble the shipwrecks that line the beach.  Two of these cabins are large enough to take extra beds – ideal for families travelling with young children.
Each luxury cabin features an en-suite bathroom, wood-burning stove for chilly evenings.
The central area comprises an innovatively designed lounge &amp; dining area with a large wrap-around deck offering panoramic views across the sand all the way to the Atlantic Ocean.

#### Activities
Shipwreck Lodge offers exciting &amp; unusual safari activities, including scenic flights in search of bleached whale bones &amp; shipwrecks &amp; cultural trips to meet the nomadic Himba people known for applying the reddish-brown powder to their skin with butter.
Other exciting activities are 4x4 drives to find desert-adapted wildlife, day trips to Mowe Bay seal colonies &amp; the Suiderkruis Shipwreck as well as sundowner drives to the roaring sand dunes of the Namib desert.
Dune boarding, quad bike trips &amp; romantic beach lunches can also be arranged.
