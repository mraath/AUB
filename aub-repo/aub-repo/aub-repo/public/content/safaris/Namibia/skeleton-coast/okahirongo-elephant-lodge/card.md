### Okahirongo Elephant Lodge

#### Experience
Okahirongo Elephant Lodge boasts a spectacular location in one of Namibia’s most remote regions:  the Purros Conservancy in the dramatic Kaokoland.
As the name suggests, this region in the far north is home to the famous desert-adaptive elephants, so guests can anticipate impressive encounters with these larger-than-life mammals.
The Kaokoland is also home to the enigmatic Himba people who, after many years have learned to adapt to this forbidding environment.
Travellers seeking to absorb the wonders of Namibia’s remote corners without compromising on modern-day comforts will fall in love with Okahirongo.

#### Stay
Okahirongo Elephant Lodge has 7 spacious chalets &amp; a presidential suite, each equipped with a private gazebo &amp; large day bed – the ideal place to relax after a fun-filled desert activity.
Each chalet has an en-suite bathroom with a bathtub that overlooks the beautiful desert surroundings &amp; features an indoor &amp; outdoor shower.  The bathrooms are in a separate hut, connected to the bedrooms by a wooden walkway.
The presidential suite consists of 2 en-suite bedrooms, a private scenic entrance, a lounge area with outdoor veranda &amp; 2 gazebos with day beds.
The main area is shaped after the traditional African tribe village &amp; boasts an infinity pool, dining room, library, lounge, boma &amp; sun deck with stunning views.

#### Activities
