# Lake Manyara
## Tanzania
### Lake Manyara

#### Experience
While most visitors to Tanzania are eager to get to the world-renowned Serengeti &amp Ngorongoro Crater, only a few realize that Lake Manyara is in a class of its own &amp should not be overlooked when planning a safari to East Africa.
The shallow alkaline lake lies at the foot of the Great Rift Valley escarpment with Lake Manyara National Park protecting the northwestern side.
A large portion of the 330 square km park is taken up by the lake, but the remarkably wide diversity of terrestrial habits – forest, wetland, floodplain &amp acacia woodland – attracts an impressive variety of wildlife.
Located a stone’s throw away from the town of Arusha - Tanzania’s entry &amp exit point for the northern safari circuit – it is easy to include Lake Manyara in a safari itinerary, ensuring guests experience the highlights of Tanzania without missing out on some Lake Manyara ‘special surprises.’
Not only is Lake Manyara one of only 3 places in the world where visitors can see the famous tree-climbing lions, but the region is also a paradise for nearly 400 species of bird – including large flocks of flamingos &amp many birds of prey.

#### Activities
Lake Manyara offers both land &amp water-based safari activities, so there is something for everyone. Exhilarating game drives in open 4x4 vehicles promise close-up wildlife encounters while canoe &amp boat safaris take you on a lake journey in search of snorting hippo pods &amp basking crocodiles.
Guided walking safaris &amp mountain bike expeditions are available for the more adventurous traveller.

#### When to travel
Lake Manyara welcomes you year-round, but the best game viewing occurs from December to February &amp May to July.
