### Ngare Serian

#### Experience
Ngare Serian boats a secluded setting in the private Mara North Conservancy in Kenya &amp; is perfectly positioned to take advantage of their exclusive conservation area – 1,500 acres that are not shared with anyone else!
Here in their own slice of Africa, guests can make their childhood dreams come true.  Tucked away in the bush &amp; a mere gentle stroll from camp is ‘The Nest,’ a treehouse sleep-out that is ideal for a small family with young children as well as a romantic night out for adventurous couples.

#### Stay
The small &amp; intimate camp comprises only 4 luxury tents dotted along the riverbank, which makes Ngare Serian a wonderful choice for exclusive-use bookings.
Each of the 4 tents includes an open bathroom overlooking the pods of hippo as well as a sunken bathtub built into the veranda decking.
The main mess tent features a long wooden dining table where candle-lit meals are enjoyed, a wooden deck complete with comfortable sofas &amp; a crackling campfire.  There is also an adjacent lounge area with enormous sofas for further relaxation.

#### Activities
Because of the camp’s superb location in a private conservancy, a wide range of safari activities are available.
These include game drives, night drives, fishing in the river, walking safaris, adventure fly-camping &amp; thrilling hot air balloon safaris over the vast Kenyan plains.
