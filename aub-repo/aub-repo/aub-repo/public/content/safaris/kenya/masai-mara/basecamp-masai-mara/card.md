#### Experience
Basecamp Masai Mara is set on the banks of the Talek River in a private concession, a short drive from Kenya’s Masai Mara gate.
This ideal location to the park provides excellent wildlife viewing opportunities combined with some of the best walking safaris in East Africa.  
The Masai Mara National Reserve – Kenya’s premier wildlife destination – is just across the river &amp; home to the highest density of wildlife in the world, which includes the Big 5 &amp; the 7th wonder of the world – the Wildebeest Migration.

#### Stay
Basecamp Masai Mara has 17 en-suite tents, each equipped with a bio-flush toilet &amp; 2 solar-heated showers (one indoor shower &amp; one open-air shower) as well as a private deck with a view towards the riverbed &amp; Masai Mara National Reserve.
One of these units is a 2-wing family tent with a shared bathroom.  This tent offers a large balcony where families or friends can relax in complete privacy.
The communal area at Basecamp comprises a cosy lounge, dining room, bar &amp; Kids Club.

#### Activities
Daily activities include open 4x4 game drives, bird walks, cultural visits, bush sundowners &amp; visits to the Enjolaata Centre, an education &amp; entertainment centre that aims to inspire the Maasai community to come together &amp; safeguard the Masai Mara.
