#### Experience
Deep in the heart of the Masai Mara’s North Conservancy &amp; overlooking the Mara River, lies Karen Blixen Camp – a luxurious &amp; eco-friendly tented haven.
The conservancy is home to a variety of wildlife, especially big cats, &amp; a key dispersal area of the annual Great Wildebeest Migration – the largest terrestrial mammal migration in the world.
With a prime riverfront setting, Karen Blixen guests can enjoy amazing armchair game viewing from the comfort of the lodge’s viewing deck as well as from their tents.

#### Stay
Accommodation comprises 22 luxury canvas tents, each set on a wooden platform offering glorious views over the Mara River &amp; its wonderful surroundings.  One of these is a family unit consisting of 2 tents with a shared veranda.
Each tent is en-suite &amp; features a spacious veranda with a cushion day bed where one can enjoy a relaxing afternoon siesta.  The bathrooms are complete with double basins &amp; romantic outdoor showers.
Karen Blixen Camp’s main area comprises a cosy lounge, dining area, swimming pool, bar &amp; wellness spa where relaxing treatments can be enjoyed.

#### Activities
A variety of exciting safari activities are available at Karen Blixen Camp.  
These include open 4x4 game drives, guided bush walks, bird watching &amp; community village visits where guests can learn more about the local Maasai people &amp; their way of life.
Hot air balloon safaris are usually the highlight of an East Africa safari &amp; should be added to everyone’s bucket list!
