# Mara Toto Camp
## Masai Mara
### Mara Toto Camp

#### Experience
With an ideal setting on the edge of the Ntiakitiak River, just a few kilometres from its sister camp, Mara Plains – Mara Toto takes you back to East Africa’s romantic safari era.
Drawing from Africa’s original explorers’ designs, this 19th-century styled expedition camp is perfectly positioned to take advantage of 2 migrations – the famous annual Serengeti Migration as well as the Green Season Migration from Loita Plains where an additional 50,000 wildebeest &amp; 100,000 zebras compete for greener pastures.
Here, safari activities take place in both the Masai Mara ecosystem as well as the more private 70,000-acre Mara North Conservancy, offering safari-goers the best of both worlds.
Being a seasonal camp, Moro Toto is only open for select months of the year (mid-May to end October), therefore offering only the best in wildlife viewing.
Leopard residents are frequently spotted wandering the riverbanks &amp; nearby lion’s calls are often heard from camp.

#### Stay
Small &amp; intimate, Mara Toto offers only 4 light &amp; airy, spacious canvas tents, each equipped with an en-suite bathroom.
Tucked away under a canopy of African ebony trees, the lantern &amp; candlelit main area is simple in design, but offers just enough creature comforts.

#### Activities
Activities at Mara Toto include early morning &amp; late afternoon / evening game drives in both the Masai Mara &amp; private Mara North Conservancy as well as visits to the Maasai bomas &amp; community schools for those interested to gain insight into local culture.
Hot air balloon safaris across the Masai Mara Reserve can also be arranged at an additional cost.  Experiencing the bush from a bird’s eye view is simply magical &amp; definitely one for the bucket list!
