## Samburu National Reserve
### Sarara Camp

#### Experience
Sarara Camp lies within the exclusive Namunyak Wildlife Conservation Trust of northern Kenya, an 850,000-acre untouched wilderness in the famed Mathews Range, also known as Lenkiyio Hills.
This area - slightly bigger than the State of New Jersey - is home to the Samburu pastoralists &amp; animals like elephant, leopard, wild dog, hyena, buffalo &amp; reticulated giraffe – most of which can be seen from the comfort of the camp’s viewing deck as they come to drink at Sarara’s resident waterhole.
Here guests can witness one of the most unique experiences in the world that is forbidden to be photographed – The fabled Samburu ‘singing wells.’  During the dry season (July – October), semi-nomadic Samburu tribes bring their livestock to dry waterholes each morning to dig for precious, life-giving water while singing.
At Sarara Camp guests can witness this important tradition where every animal recognizes their family song &amp; comes to drink when their troughs are full.  At night when the singing &amp; dancing is over, wild animals like elephant &amp; leopard come to drink from the same water sources – a beautiful exchange between human &amp; animal.

#### Stay
Sarara has 6 luxury tents, each positioned to maximize the beautiful views of the mountains &amp; waterhole.  There is also a 2-bedroom house with a shared sitting / dining area – ideal for families.
Each spacious tent has high ceilings, an outdoor bathroom offering glorious views over the hills as well as a private terrace with a table &amp; chairs where early morning coffee &amp; tea are served.
The main lodge consists of a lounge, dining area &amp; terrace with a natural rock swimming pool overlooking a resident waterhole where animals like elephant, kudu, impala, warthog &amp; wild dog come to drink.

#### Activities
A range of thrilling safari activities is offered at Sarara Camp.
These include day &amp; night drives in open 4x4 safari vehicles, guided walks, horse riding, village visits, trips to the Reteti Elephant Sanctuary, full day trips to Mount Ololokwe, scenic flights &amp; visits to the local blacksmiths.  Guests can also visit the nearby natural rock pools in season.
