# SaSaab Camp
## Samburu National Reserve
### SaSaab Camp

#### Experience
The Moroccan-inspired SaSaab Camp is set above the Easo Nyiro River in Samburu National Reserve &amp; offers jaw-dropping views over the Samburu plains towards Mount Kenya.
The reserve is home to an abundance of wildlife, including classic savannah animals &amp; some of northern Kenya’s more unusual species.
SaSaab’s camelback safaris &amp; fly-camping adventures are wonderful ways of exploring the pristine wilderness – &amp; activities that should be added to everyone’s bucket list!

#### Stay
SaSaab boasts 7 luxury suites &amp; 1 family suite, all designed with absolute privacy in mind.
Each spacious suite features a private plunge pool, chill out space (either a veranda or mini-garden) &amp; a large open-air bathroom.  The lodge is located on a steep bank, so guests with walking difficulties should request a room near the mess, which is easily accessible.
The family suite consists of 2 inter-connecting rooms which are ideal for families or 2 couples travelling together.  The family suite also has a private plunge pool.
The main area includes a mess tent with a spa, pool &amp; gym.

#### Activities
Activities at SaSaab Camp are ample!  
They include game drives, helicopter flights, fly-camping, spa treatments, camel rides, quad biking &amp; visits to the nearby markets &amp; villages.
Other activities on the list are nature walks, sundowner excursions &amp; painting.
