### Porini Amboseli Camp

#### Experience
The award-winning Amboseli Porini Camp is set within the private Selenkay Conservation area which lies a few miles north of the Amboseli National Park.  
This area is home to an abundance of resident game &amp; migrating wildlife - including elephant, lion, leopard, cheetah &amp; a variety of bird species.  
Since the camp is set within a private concession, day &amp; night drives are permitted – so guests will have the opportunity to experience close-up wildlife encounters during the day &amp; spot nocturnal animals at night.

#### Stay
Accommodation at Porini Amboseli comprises 10 spacious tents.  
Each canvas tent is unfussy yet comfortable, with a private veranda, an en-suite bathroom with a bucket walk-in shower.
The communal tent includes a lounge &amp; dining area where relaxing meals are enjoyed.

#### Activities
Daily safari activities include open 4x4 game drives, guided nature walks &amp; night drives where guests will look for nocturnal animals with a spotlight.  
Bird enthusiasts will be delighted to know that the area is known for its wide range of birds of prey.
