### Majete Wildlife Reserve

#### Experience
Through massive conservation efforts that started in 2003, the 700 square km Majete Wildlife Reserve has become Malawi’s premier wildlife destination - yet still offers its guests an intimate &amp off-the-beaten-track safari experience.
On the eastern boundary, you will find the Shire River – a magnet for larger animals. Majete Wildlife Reserve safari and boating safaris along the palm-fringed shores of the Shire River are usually the best way to get closer to some of the larger animals like elephant &amp hippo.
Since the early 2,000’s the park has been intensely protected &amp re-stocked with game &amp over the years, have become the most interesting wildlife reserve in Malawi. Majete wildlife conservation efforts have made it a thriving ecosystem.
A Majete off-the-beaten-track safari will appeal to adventure travelers who prefer an off-the-beaten-track safari experience in a wild &amp rugged setting.

#### Activities
Majete Wildlife Reserve offers a wide selection of safari activities, including Majete guided walking safaris &amp Majete local village visits. Boating safaris along the palm-fringed shores of the Shire River is a wonderful way of getting close to wildlife, &amp open 4x4 game drives explore the park’s expansive floodplains in search of the Big 5 – lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo &amp rhino.
Majete is also home to a variety of other wildlife, including hippo, crocodile, sable &amp roan antelope, eland, zebra &amp spotted hyena.
Guided walking safaris are also a popular activity as well as visits to local villages where guests can learn more about local culture.

#### When to travel
Majete Wildlife Reserve offers great wildlife viewing throughout the year, but the best time to visit Majete is during the dry winter months, from July to October when the grass is low, which makes it easier to spot wildlife. At this time, water in the bush has dried out &amp animals congregate at the river.
Keep in mind that October is very hot and not the ideal time for being in the bush.
During the rainy season – between December &amp March, the conditions are generally hot and wet.
