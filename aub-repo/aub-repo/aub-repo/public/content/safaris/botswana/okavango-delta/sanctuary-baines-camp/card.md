### Sanctuary Baines' Camp

#### Experience
Sanctuary Baines’ Camp is located within a private concession, bordering the Moremi Game Reserve &amp; is home to some of the most spectacular wildlife on earth.
Set among the shady trees on the southern edge of the Okavango Delta, this eco-friendly lodge provides an intimate African experience.  The camp overlooks a large lagoon, making this a prime location for water safaris.

#### Stay
Small &amp; intimate, Sanctuary Baines’ Camp consists of only 6 suites set on elevated platforms in the tree line.  Romantic 4-poster beds are provided in each suite, completely mobile – allowing guests to sleep under the stars.  This is Botswana luxury at its best.  Wi-Fi is available in the rooms.
The main area at Sanctuary Baines’ Camp features a lounge, dining area &amp; large viewing deck for a truly African outdoor experience.  A sparkling swimming pool offers guests the opportunity to cool off after a day out in the African sun.

#### Activities
A variety of activities makes Sanctuary Baines’ Camp a popular safari location.  Open 4x4 game drives, nature walks, mokoro trips in dug-out canoes &amp; motorboat safaris are all available.
A highlight for most guests is walking with 2 semi-habituated elephants, Jabu &amp; Morula.  Guests will have the opportunity to enjoy a leisurely paced walk with them, observing &amp; interacting with them, &amp; end with a picnic lunch in their company.
