# Kiri Camp
## Okavango Delta
### Kiri Camp

#### Experience
Kiri Camp is located within a private concession in one of Botswana’s most remote areas in the heart of the Okavango Delta, one of the world’s largest inland deltas.
The camp derives its name from the Kiri channel which flows past the island on which the camp is situated. 
The wildlife in the Kiri area is diverse &amp; plentiful, renowned for its lion &amp; buffalo interactions &amp; frequent wild dog sightings.  Since Kiri Camp is situated within a private concession, off-road game drives &amp; night drives are allowed, allowing guests ‘front row seats’ when viewing Botswana’s wildlife.

#### Stay
Kiri Camp offers 8 luxury tents with en-suite facilities as well as a luxury family suite consisting of 2 en-suite tents sharing a common area.  The tents are designed to incorporate the surrounding ebony forest under which the camp is situated.
The main area is raised on a large viewing deck, providing spectacular views over the mighty Kiri floodplains which stretch out in front of the camp.

#### Activities
There is a variety of exciting land &amp; water-based activities to be enjoyed at Kiri Camp.  These include day &amp; night game drives with a qualified ranger, guided walking safaris as well as motorboat trips &amp; mokoro safaris in dug-out canoes during peak flood times.
