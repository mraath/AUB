# Little Tubu
## Okavango Delta
### Little Tubu

#### Experience
Little Tubu is situated on the Okavango Delta’s Hunda Island, next to its sister camp, Tubu Tree, connected to it by boardwalks.  
Hunda Island is the largest area of permanently dry land in the Okavango Delta.  The diverse habitats, including mopane, riverine forest &amp; dry Kalahari sandveld allow for diverse &amp; spectacular wildlife viewing.
Because the camp is situated in an area with the most palatable grasses, animals flock here daily &amp; often guests can experience fantastic plains game viewing from the main viewing deck.

#### Stay
Little Tubu is small &amp; intimate, with only 3 en-suite traditional-style tents – ensuring a private or exclusive safari experience.  Each has a private viewing deck &amp; a romantic outdoor shower.
Elevated walkways link the tents to the main dining, bar &amp; pool areas that are designed to blend seamlessly into the surrounding environment &amp; maximize spectacular views.
Not too far from camp is a Star Bed for romantic sleep-outs under the African sky.

#### Activities
Year-round day &amp; night drives are conducted in open 4x4 safari vehicles.  Other activities include mokoro safaris in dug-out canoes, boating, romantic Star Bed sleep-outs as well as catch &amp; release fishing.
