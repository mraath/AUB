# Gomoti Private Camp
## Okavango Delta
### Gomoti Private Camp

#### Experience
Gomoti Private Camp is located on the edge of the Gomoti River system southeast of the Okavango Delta.  As the name suggests, the camp is small &amp; intimate, offering guests total privacy &amp; exclusivity in a luxurious Botswana safari setting.
In Botswana, the locals know the Gomoti tree as the ‘water fig’ as it grows alongside the Okavango Delta’s waterways &amp; sometimes grows no bigger than a bush.  Large concentrations of wildlife thrive on the Gomoti plains &amp; waterways as the trees provide excellent cover for nesting water birds.

#### Stay
Gomoti Private Camp offers total exclusivity, &amp; only has 1 double tent &amp; 1 family tent, accommodating a maximum of 6 guests in camp at any given time.  All tents have indoor &amp; outdoor showers as well as en-suite facilities.  
The main area consists of a small dining &amp; lounge area with a private plunge pool.  Guests can relax &amp; enjoy the sounds of Africa from the campfire at night, indulging in one of Africa’s primal pleasures.

#### Activities
A variety of land &amp; water-based safari activities is available at Gomoti Private Camp.  
These include day &amp; night open 4x4 game drives, mokoro safaris in dug-out canoes, guided nature walks, helicopter scenic flights over the Delta as well as gourmet picnics &amp; on-site massages.
