# Duba Explorers Camp
## Okavango Delta
### Duba Explorers Camp

#### Experience
Located away from its sister camp, Duba Plains, Duba Explorers Camp is set on a tree-covered island in the northeastern corner of the Okavango Delta &amp; is easily one of the most remote camps in Botswana.  
Situated on a 30,000-hectare private concession, the surroundings are dominated by a permanent floodplain, interspersed with seasonable floodplains &amp; grasslands as well as pockets of mopane &amp; acacia woodlands.
Being part of a floodplain for most of the year, the camp is only accessible by 2 gum pole bridges, proving that guests are completely surrounded by nature.

#### Stay
Duba Explorers Camp has been designed by Dereck &amp; Beverly Joubert, National Geographic explorers themselves, &amp; passionate about everything Africa has to offer.  
The camp consists of 5 en-suite canvas tents built on raised decks, offering spectacular views over the channels of the Okavango Delta.
The main area is set under sweeping marquee canvas, on raised decking with an open-concept dining &amp; lounge area.

#### Activities
Duba Explorers Camp offers the best of both worlds – land &amp; water-based safari activities – exactly how a true Botswana luxury safari should be experienced!
Guests can enjoy both day &amp; night drives in open 4x4 vehicles, walking safaris, mokoro trips in dug-out canoes, boating on the waterways of the Okavango Delta or catch &amp; release fishing.
The complimentary Young Explorers Programme at Duba Explorers Camp will keep the young ones entertained.  Kids will learn about animal calls, how to track wildlife &amp; enjoy a variety of arts &amp; craft activities in &amp; around camp.
