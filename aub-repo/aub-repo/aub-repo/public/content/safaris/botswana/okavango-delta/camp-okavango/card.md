### Camp Okavango

#### Experience
Camp Okavango is set within the heart of the Okavango Delta on Nxaragha Island.  Surrounded by water channels &amp; spectacular scenery, this lodge is perfect for guests wishing to experience a classic Okavango Delta luxury safari.
Since the camp is situated on a private island, guests can experience pure tranquillity &amp; seclusion – something that can only be found in the most remote regions of Botswana.

#### Stay
There are only 11 intimate safari suites on raised teak platforms, each equipped with an en-suite bathroom &amp; a large viewing deck.  The en-suite bathrooms each have double vanities, a double shower &amp; a separate water closet with a view.  
The stack away sliding doors open onto a private open-air viewing deck offering beautiful views over the Okavango Delta.
Families travelling with children can stay in the family suite, consisting of 2 bedrooms &amp; 2 en-suite bathrooms.
The main lodge features a cocktail bar, sitting area &amp; wildlife library, with the dining room leading onto an expansive open-air patio where evenings are often enjoyed around the fire. Other facilities include a secluded bird-viewing hide &amp; sundeck with a plunge pool.

#### Activities
Camp Okavango offers a year-round water experience in traditional mokoros (dug-out canoes), motorboat safaris &amp; bush walks on the many surrounding islands.  All safari activities are conducted by experienced guides.  
Guests can also see the Okavango Delta from a helicopter – a truly magnificent experience. (additional cost)
