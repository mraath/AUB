# Okavango Delta
## Botswana
### Okavango Delta

#### Experience
Picture this: A pure river bursts out of wild highlands &amp then meanders lazily through an African wilderness. Finally, it spills into a 6,000 square mile maze of lagoons, channels &amp islands. This is the Okavango Delta, Africa’s premier wildlife destination.
Known as “the river that never finds the sea,” Botswana’s Okavango Delta is the largest inland delta in the world.
This pristine wilderness area - teeming with wildlife - is a spectacular sight that should be on everyone’s bucket list!
The Okavango Delta is a year-round safari destination where you can come eye-to-eye with some of Africa’s fiercest creatures.

#### Activities
Because it is a freshwater wetland, the Okavango Delta offers guests both land &amp water activities.
Experience the vast open plains on open 4x4 game drive, always accompanied by a qualified ranger. Walking safaris are also available in some areas, so be prepared to leave footprints behind.
The real highlight of a trip to the Okavango Delta’s swamps is the mokoro trips – an activity unique to Botswana. These dug-out guided canoes will take you downstream to look for birds &amp aquatic antelope. It is great fun exploring the waterways of the Delta by honoring this local tradition.
Finish the day with a boat cruise, while sipping on a cool sundowner &amp watch the sunset.

#### When to travel
The Okavango Delta has 3 distinct safari seasons.
The best time to travel is during high season - between July &amp October - when the bush is dry &amp the channels of the Okavango Delta are full.
Shoulder season, which is from April to June &amp November, is also a great time to travel &amp rates are less expensive than during high season.
Green season is during the summer, between December to March, when Botswana receives rain, so the bush is lush &amp birdlife is amazing. During the rainy season, rates are at their lowest.
