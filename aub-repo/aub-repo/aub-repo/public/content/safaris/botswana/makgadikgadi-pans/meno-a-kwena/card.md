## Makgadikgadi Pans
### Meno A Kwena

#### Experience
Meno a Kwena boasts a spectacular location on the Boteti River overlooking the Makgadikgadi Pans National Park â€“ a completely contrasting location to the green &amp; lush Okavango Delta region.
The zebra migration is resident here for much of the year, &amp; in the dry season there is no other water around, so the Boteti River becomes the magnet for wildlife.

#### Stay
There are 8 double safari tents at Meno a Kwena, 6 of which are twin tents &amp; 2 are king tents.  Each twin tent is equipped with an indoor &amp; outdoor shower, whereas the king tents all have outdoor showers.  
Meno a Kwena also has 2 family tents.  One of them accommodates a family of 5 with 1 king bed &amp; 3 single beds.  The second family tent can accommodate a family of 4, with 1 king bed &amp; 2 single beds.  Each tent is en-suite with indoor &amp; outdoor showers.

#### Activities
Walking safaris with Bushmen from the Ju! Hoansi clan are immensely interesting since guests can learn about their hunter-gatherer way of life as they have coexisted with wildlife for many years.  This gentle walk appeals to all ages.
The popular Pans-Sleep-Out is the adventure of a lifetime!  This unique safari experience will take your breath away as you fall asleep under the African skies. 
A 2-hour boat cruise along the Boteti River is ideal for bird lovers &amp; there is a photographic hide on the water that offers a new perspective to wildlife in &amp; around the river.  
Guests can also enjoy open 4x4 game drives within the Makgadikgadi Pans National Park.
