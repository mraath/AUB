## Makgadikgadi Pans
### San Camp

#### Experience
San Camp, a romantic &amp; luxurious desert camp is set in a private concession on the border of the Makgadikgadi Pans of Botswana.
With only the desert &amp; salt pans as a backdrop, San Camp provides an opportunity for guests to get away from it all &amp; enjoy the solitude &amp; tranquillity that can only be found in the desert.

#### Stay
A maximum of 14 guests is accommodated in 7 large, white canvas tents on slightly elevated wooden platforms, each equipped with an en-suite bathroom.  The views from the tent’s viewing decks are truly magnificent.
The lodge’s main area consists of an open-plan comfortable lounge, dining room, bar &amp; exercise pavilion.

#### Activities
San Camp offers open 4x4 safari drives in the Makgadikgadi National Park as well as exciting walks through the concession. A real highlight is spending time with the resident meerkats, something unique to this area.  
Quad bike trips to the Ntwetwe Pan is a great way to explore the area &amp; guests can also enjoy picnics, set up in beautiful desert locations.  Horseback safaris are also offered, as well as trips to The Fallen Boabab – one of three of the largest &amp; oldest trees in Africa.
During summer, the biggest drawing card is experiencing the awe-inspiring spectacle of Southern Africa’s last surviving zebra &amp; wildebeest migration.
