### Chobe Princess

#### Experience
The Chobe Princess is a luxury houseboat based on the Chobe River in Botswana, but it is officially a joint Namibian &amp; Botswana property as the river forms the boundary between these two countries.
A unique &amp; elegant experience, The Chobe Princess will take you on a journey through some of Africa’s most beautiful &amp; scenic regions.

#### Stay
Two of the Chobe Princess houseboats have four cabins each:  3 Standard and 1 Superior Cabin.
The third Princess is larger with five cabins: 3 Standard and 2 Superior Cabins – one with a front balcony and the other located on the upper (top) deck.
Each cabin on The Chobe Princess is tastefully decorated in a contemporary style, &amp; each has a private view of the ever-changing landscapes beyond.  On the upper entertainment deck, a spacious lounge &amp; bar area encourages you to take time out while there is also a plunge pool that’s perfect for a refreshing dip.
The entire boat can also be booked exclusively.

#### Activities
The Chobe Princess offers a variety of activities from the boat as well as the surrounding areas.  Game viewing in smaller boats will enable close encounters &amp; wonderful photo opportunities.
Tiger &amp; bream fishing in season are also available.  Bird lovers will be delighted to know that they can tick off their list from the privacy of these smaller boats.
Open 4x4 game viewing &amp; cultural visits to nearby villages will give guests the chance to explore the local region by jeep or on foot.  Aerial helicopter sightings are on offer at an additional cost.
