### Mankwe Tented Retreat

#### Experience
Mankwe Tented Retreat boasts an unbeatable setting in a private concession on the doorstep of the game-rich Moremi Game Reserve.
The retreat is tucked away in a grove of mopane trees &amp; mysterious woodlands, offering guests the best of both land &amp; water-based safari activities.
Small &amp; intimate, Mankwe Tented Retreat is an oasis for the safari soul in search for a tranquil atmosphere - away from crowds.

#### Stay
The retreat features 10 tented suites that are built on raised wooden platforms, each with an en-suite bathroom &amp; a private viewing deck overlooking the surrounding wilderness.
The main lodge houses 2 sparkling swimming pools, a dining area, a small boma &amp; a lounge/reading area branching off from the meandering walkway, offering a complete sense of privacy.  
There is also a small spa room for relaxing post-safari treatments. (Bookings have to be made in advance.)

#### Activities
Exciting land &amp; water-based activities are available at Mankwe Tented Retreat.  And eager safari-goers can even tailor-make their own safari schedule!
Activities include open 4x4 game drives &amp; sundowner excursions on Mankwe’s concession, exhilarating boat cruises through the reed-lined channels of the Okavango Delta or full-day trips into the Khwai River section of the Moremi.
From the comfort of the camp’s viewing deck, guests frequently spot African wild dogs, elephants, honey badgers &amp; a colourful array of birdlife.
