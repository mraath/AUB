### Pelo Camp

#### Experience
As the name suggests, Pelo means ‘heart’ in Setswana, &amp; from the air, the island on which this beautiful camp is situated appears heart-shaped.  
Pelo Camp has been designed to respect the environment, so this light-footprint eco-friendly camp is built from natural materials, operating on 100% solar power &amp; offering low-impact carbon-neutral activities.

#### Stay
Accommodation at Pelo Camp consists of only 5 spacious tents looking out over the surrounding water.  Each tent boasts an en-suite bathroom &amp; veranda offering beautiful views over the bush.
The main area comprises a tented dining area &amp; lounge situated under impressive jackalberry &amp; mahogany trees.   The raised viewing platform built onto an old anthill provides uninterrupted views over the wild.

#### Activities
Guests staying at Pelo Camp can glide seamlessly along the waterways of the Delta in a traditional dug-out canoe called a mokoro &amp; take in the abundance of water-loving wildlife &amp; birds.  
Their 12-seater boat allows up, close &amp; personal encounters with animals such as red lechwe, elephant &amp; maybe even spotted-necked otter.
During a walking safari, guests will learn about the River Bushman’s way of life in this area.  Catch-&amp;-release fishing with basic equipment is also on offer – season dependent.
