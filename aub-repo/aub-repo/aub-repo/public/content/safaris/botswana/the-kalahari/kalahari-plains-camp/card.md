## The Kalahari
### Kalahari Plains Camp

#### Experience
Kalahari Plains Camp is situated in a remote part of the Central Kalahari Game Reserve &amp; offers some of the best summer wildlife opportunities on the continent.
This 5million hectares reserve is the largest conservation area in the country &amp; one of the largest in the world.  The Central Kalahari Game Reserve is home to the legendary Kalahari black-maned lion &amp; some of the world’s best cheetah viewing.

#### Stay
The camp is built on the edge of an immense pan where beautiful views can be enjoyed &amp; lazy days can be spent. 
It comprises 8 en-suite canvas tents, each kitted out with a private sleep-out above from which to enjoy Africa’s starry skies.  One of these tents is a 2-bedroom family unit, with 2 bedrooms &amp; 2 en-suite bathrooms.
The main area consists of a lounge &amp; dining area as well as a sparkling swimming pool &amp; deck area.  Kalahari Plains Camp is a 100% solar-powered camp, so temperatures throughout the lodge are comfortable.

#### Activities
Activities include open 4x4 game drives &amp; walks with Bushmen – a unique experience to the Central Kalahari Game Reserve.  Sleeping out under the stars is also a must!

During the rainy summer months, between November &amp; April, the desert truly comes to life.  Short grasses sprout in the pan systems &amp; riverbeds, attracting thousands of plains game such as springbok &amp; gemsbok.  
Wildebeest, steenbok &amp; red hartebeest also make their way towards the pans – with lion, leopard, cheetah &amp; jackal following shortly.
