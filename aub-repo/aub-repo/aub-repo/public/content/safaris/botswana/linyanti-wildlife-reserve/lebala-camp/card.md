# Lebala Camp
## Linyanti Wildlife Reserve
### Lebala Camp

#### Experience
Kwando Lebala Camp is situated in the southern region of the Kwando concession in Botswana, adjacent to the Linyanti marshes that form the boundary between Botswana &amp; Namibia.
The Kwando River disappears into the marshland before emerging as the Linyanti River, an important source of life to a wide variety of animals &amp; birds.

#### Stay
Lebala means ‘wide open spaces’ in Setswana &amp; after visiting, it is not surprising to see why.  The scenery is dominated by vast plains with scattered palms &amp; tree islands backed by wooden savannahs.
The camp itself is comprised of 8 stylish safari tents, each with an en-suite bathroom &amp; unique mosquito net walls, allowing for unobstructed views over the Linyanti.  Each tent has a double outdoor shower overlooking the bush.  One of the tents has an additional twin bedroom within the unit for family use.
The main lodge area has a boma where guests can sit around the campfire, sharing some of their wildlife stories as well as a dining room &amp; deck with a sparkling swimming pool.

#### Activities
Safari drives are conducted in open 4x4 vehicles &amp; bush walks are also offered from Lebala Camp.  While game viewing from a vehicle allows one to see more animals as you traverse much greater distances and get much closer to animals safely, there is nothing as awe-inspiring and humbling as observing wild animals on foot.
A variety of Africa’s plains game, such as zebra, wildebeest, impala, giraffe &amp; waterbuck can also be seen in this area.
