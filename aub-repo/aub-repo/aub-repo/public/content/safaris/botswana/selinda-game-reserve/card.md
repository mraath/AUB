## Botswana
### Selinda Game Reserve

#### Experience
The private Selinda Game Reserve, an area that links the Okavango Delta to the west with the Linyanti Swamps to the east, stretches across 130,000 hectares &amp comprises the Selinda Spillway, dense marshes, riverine woodlands &amp sprawling savannas.
The reserve has a thriving animal population in this remote oasis in northern Botswana, boasting elephants by the thousands &amp regular sightings of African wild dogs.
This is spurred by its participation in the Great Plains Conservation Project which exists to conserve &amp expand natural habitats, using sustainable eco-tourism to protect &amp restore critical habitats, conserve wildlife &amp benefit local communities.
During the dry season, excellent wildlife sightings can be expected while the wet, rainy season will give guests the chance to spot Selinda Reserve’s 300 bird species.
There are only a handful of camps in this wild region of Botswana – which can only be reached by small plane – ensuring an intimate &amp authentic safari experience.

#### Activities
Visitors to the Selinda Game Reserve will be able to enjoy open 4x4 game drives &amp exciting walking safaris.
Since the reserve is private, off-road driving is permitted – which will bring guests right into the middle of the action. Close-up wildlife encounters in Selinda are ample.
In the evenings, guests will depart on night drives in search of elusive nocturnal animals. Many of the safari camps also offer Young Explorers Programmes for little travelers.
There are also mobile exploration treks that combine canoeing &amp walking.

#### When to travel
The best time to visit the northern reaches of Botswana is from July to October, during the dry winter season when temperatures are moderate &amp wildlife viewing is exceptional.
During the shoulder season, April to May &amp November, game viewing is also good &amp rates are lower than in high season. The wet, low season is from December to March. Bird watching is at its best &amp rates are extremely competitive.
