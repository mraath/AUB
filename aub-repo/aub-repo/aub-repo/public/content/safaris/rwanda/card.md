# Rwanda
## SAFARIS
### Rwanda

#### Experience
Rwanda is home to half of the world’s existing gorilla population & has become known as Africa’s easiest & most accessible gorilla trekking destination.
Volcanoes National Park is Rwanda’s biggest drawcard. This legendary park boasts 300 habituated – but still wild - endangered mountain gorillas & includes a range of exciting safari activities, such as forest hikes to find the rare golden monkey, nature walks to the grave of Diane Fossey & even scenic helicopter flights over the park to enjoy a bird’s eye view.
Exciting chimpanzee trekking safaris can be done at the Nyungwe Forest National Park while you can tick off the coveted Big 5 at Akagera National Park. The beautiful Lake Kivu- one of Africa’s Great Lakes - is the ideal place to end a Rwanda holiday. Here, you can enjoy breathtaking scenery, immaculate beaches & a variety of water-based activities such as canoeing, boating & fishing.
Rwanda combines easily with other East African destinations like Uganda, Kenya & Tanzania.

#### Stay
Accommodation in Rwanda generally falls into 2 categories: hotels in the capital of Kigali & safari lodges or tented camps in Rwanda’s parks & reserves. Safari lodges or camps provide the ideal base from which to go gorilla trekking & here you can also expect amazing forest views & plenty of adventure.
Rwanda offers accommodation for all types of travellers - from comfortable forest chalets & family-friendly lodges to exclusive hideaways & luxurious villas.

#### When to travel
Although gorilla trekking is regarded as a year-round activity, the best time to visit Rwanda for a gorilla trek is during the short dry season from mid-December to early February or over the long dry season months of June to September. During this time, the hiking conditions are at their best.
The best time to visit Rwanda for a chimpanzee trekking safari in Nyungwe, however, is during the 2 rainy seasons from mid-February to early June & from mid-September to mid-December. It is easier to locate the apes during the rainy season. (During the dry season, food is harder to find, so chimp families often range far into the forest interior.)
