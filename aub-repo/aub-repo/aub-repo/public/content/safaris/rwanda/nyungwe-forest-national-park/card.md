#### Experience
Nestled in the picturesque southwest corner of Rwanda lies the awe-inspiring Nyungwe Forest National Park, a sprawling tropical rainforest spanning 100,000 hectares. This remarkable sanctuary is renowned for its astonishing biodiversity, boasting a rich tapestry of flora &amp fauna waiting to be discovered.
Nyungwe Forest is most celebrated for its exceptional chimpanzee trekking safaris, offering visitors an opportunity to witness these magnificent creatures in their natural habitat. The park is also home to a total of 13 primate species, including the Angolan colobus monkey &amp grey-cheeked mangabeys. Among its many attractions is East Africa's highest canopy walk, suspended 20 meters above the forest floor, offering a bird's-eye view of this lush realm.
Well-kept hiking trails, shaded by a canopy of ancient trees, beckon explorers on a magical journey through the forest. Along these trails, you'll uncover hidden treasures, including the sight of 310 bird species, hundreds of butterfly species, orchids, &amp over 75 species of mammals. Nyungwe Forest's status as a lesser-known destination outside East Africa ensures an untouched &amp pristine atmosphere.

For those desiring a touch of intimacy, wilderness picnics &amp private dinners are ideal options for couples or families seeking privacy &amp serenity within this lush paradise.

#### When to travel
Nyungwe Forest welcomes visitors throughout the year. The wet months, spanning from October to May, are the prime time for chimpanzee trekking &amp forest birding, making it an excellent time for birdwatching enthusiasts. During these months, the forest comes alive with vibrant flora &amp fauna.
