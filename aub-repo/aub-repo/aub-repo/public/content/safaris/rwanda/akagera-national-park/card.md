Within Akagera's embrace, you'll find the renowned Big 5 – the majestic lion, elusive leopard, formidable elephant, formidable buffalo, &amp the rhino. Yet, this sanctuary extends beyond the iconic five; it's also a paradise for bird enthusiasts with over 480 bird species, including the rare &amp prehistoric-looking shoebill stork.
