# Intercontinental Hotel
## Johannesburg
### Intercontinental Hotel

#### Experience
Located just a few steps outside OR Tambo’s International Arrivals Hall, the Intercontinental Hotel offers guests the perfect blend between luxury &amp; comfort.
Standing proud, just shy of 70 meters from the airport building, the Intercontinental Hotel is – without a doubt – Johannesburg’s best option for an overnight stay.  Regardless of your arrival time, there is no need to wait for a taxi or sit in traffic – after only a few steps, you will reach your destination.
The hotel boasts a wellness spa, fitness centre &amp; a heated swimming pool for those wishing to get rejuvenated after a long-haul flight.
Dining is important at the Intercontinental Hotel.  Delicious breakfasts are served along with African-fushion cuisine at their on-site restaurant.  In-room dining is also available.

#### Stay
The hotel is home to 108 deluxe rooms, 27 executive rooms, 2 presidential suites &amp; 1 disabled room.
The well-appointed deluxe rooms are tastefully decorated with subtle influences of Africa.  These rooms have spacious showers, blackout curtains &amp; soundproofing to ensure a night of relaxation.  
Executive rooms occupy corners of the hotel providing impressive views &amp; ample natural light.  En-suite bathrooms have luxurious showers with massage showerheads to ensure the utmost comfort.  
Families who request inter-leading rooms can book an executive room &amp; deluxe room next door as one unit.  Due to minimal inter-leading rooms, specifying this need is important.  The 2 presidential suites are located on the 7th floor &amp; boast beautiful views.  
Hotel facilities include a restaurant, cocktail bar, gym, spa &amp; swimming pool.

#### Activities
Guided day trips are popular in Johannesburg.  These include tours of the city, township, museums, art galleries &amp; trendy shopping venues.  Hot air balloon safaris &amp; day trips to the nearby Pilanesberg National Park can also be arranged.
