Situated right on the beach, Schulphoek does not only offer spectacular views of the ocean but also provides the ideal spot to enjoy excellent whale watching from the comfort of the lounge or outside terrace.
An extra value-add is the surprising complimentary 4-course dinner waiting for you on your 1st night.  Meals have been freshly prepared with ingredients from the garden while excellent South African wines can be enjoyed from their wide selection.

Each suite is individually decorated, boasting fine linens, goose-down duvets &amp; en-suite bathrooms. Rooms are spacious &amp; offer either sweeping views of the bay or a patio that walks out into the quiet gardens.
Communal areas include a peaceful library with a selection of books &amp; a comfortable lounge to unwind &amp;, during whale season, spot southern right whales in the ocean from the comfort of the sofas.  
This eco-conscious boutique hotel also features a swimming pool with sun loungers &amp; an open-plan kitchen that allows guests to see the resident chef at work.  Schulphoek also has an impressive wine collection of over 7,000 wines.
