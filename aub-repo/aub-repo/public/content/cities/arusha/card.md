## CITIES
### Arusha

#### Experience
Welcome to Arusha! The city’s bustling streets, buzzing markets &amp; vibrant nightlife offers visitors a wide selection of boutique-style hotels, culture &amp; endless activities.
While the city is often only a stopover for many as it acts as the gateway to Tanzania’s greatest wildlife destinations, a day or two in the city will treat guests to an inside look at one of the country’s flourishing metropolises.
Kilimanjaro International Airport is only a short 20-minute drive from the domestic Arusha Airport, so visitors can conveniently fly directly from Zanzibar, making the Arusha region an easy add-on to a Zanzibar itinerary.
