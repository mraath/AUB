### Hatari Lodge

#### Experience
Located at the slopes of Mount Meru in Arusha National Park’s Ngurdoto Crater – also known as a ‘little Serengeti’ – Hatari Lodge boasts eclectic décor, spectacular wildlife viewing &amp; a range of exciting safari activities.
The nearby Momela Lakes are home to a variety of wildlife, including waterfowls, lazy hippos, black-&amp;-white colobus monkeys &amp; pink flamingos.
Hatari’s private jetty runs into a popular waterhole where elephant calves &amp; their protective mothers are often seen drinking or playing in the water.

#### Stay
Accommodation comprises 9 deluxe rooms, 3 junior suites &amp; 3 Hatari suites.  
The deluxe rooms are decorated with a fun, stylish mix of bright cushions &amp; throws made from local textiles &amp; feature en-suite bathrooms &amp; open fireplaces.  
Two of these rooms are ideal for honeymooners as they boast large bathtubs &amp; breathtaking views over the Momela clearing or Kilimanjaro.
The junior suites boast natural interiors of traditional Swahili coastal style &amp; are more spacious than the deluxe rooms.  Each junior suite enjoys beautiful views over the iconic Mount Kilimanjaro.
Joined with the junior suites, the Hatari suites form the perfect villa which can sleep up to 6 people &amp; therefore an ideal choice for families or friends traveling together.  These private suites have their own private dining area &amp; overlook a dramatic vista of Mount Meru.
Hatari Lodge consists of 3 beautifully restored farmstead buildings.  The largest houses a comfortable lounge, dining area &amp; breakfast terrace from where excellent armchair game viewing can be enjoyed.  There is also a bar, garden, library &amp; sitting rooms.
