# Entebbe & Kampala
## CITIES
### Entebbe & Kampala

#### Experience
The capital of Uganda – Kampala, is the country’s commercial, political &amp; logistical hub, but also one of East Africa’s most friendly &amp; relaxed cities.
A mere 60-minute drive away, you will find the laid-back Entebbe – a modern &amp; picturesque city that is home to the country’s international airport as well as Africa’s largest lake, the beautiful Lake Victoria.
Both Kampala &amp; Entebbe are the ideal pitstop destinations for a gorilla or chimp-trekking safari to Uganda.

#### Activities
There’s lots of things to see and do in Entebbe-Kampala. Visitors to Kampala should make a stop at the National Cultural Centre - commonly known as the National Theatre where guests can enjoy a line-up of live music, film, dance &amp; drama in the auditorium. There are also a variety of restaurants, bars &amp; nightly outdoor events including drumming &amp; comedy nights.
Kampala is also home to the UNESCO listed Kasubi Tombs – the burial site for the kings &amp; the royal family of the Buganda kingdom. Kampala is dotted with colorful crafts markets – including the popular Crafts Village – that sells vibrant crafts ranging from prints, baskets, paintings, pottery, jewelry &amp; more.
Some Entebbe travel highlights include a list of attractions  &amp; activities like the Entebbe Wildlife Educational Centre – home to an array of interesting animals  &amp; the Entebbe Botanical Gardens where guests can relax  &amp; enjoy an introduction to Uganda’s abundant birdlife.
Visitors can also spend an afternoon fishing on Lake Victoria (a must-visit place in Entebbe) or cruise to nearby Ngamba Island to view orphaned and rehabilitated chimpanzees.

#### When to travel
The best time to visit Kampala  &amp; Entebbe is during its 2 dry seasons: between December  &amp; February,  &amp; between June  &amp; September. During these dryer months, the conditions are particularly good for trekking to see mountain gorillas  &amp; chimpanzees.
