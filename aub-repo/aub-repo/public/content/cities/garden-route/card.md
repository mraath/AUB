### Garden Route

#### Experience
South Africa’s world-renowned Garden Route is a sunny stretch of coastline that lies just a few hours’ drive from the vibrant city of Cape Town, featuring a wonderful blend of beautiful beaches, lush forests, tranquil lagoons &amp; bustling seaside towns.
The malaria-free Garden Route is a big drawcard to independent families who prefer to do self-drive holidays &amp; explore at their own pace as well as nature lovers &amp; outdoor enthusiasts who are eager to tick off a list of exciting activities.
The short driving distances between the charming seaside towns that make up the Garden Route – of which Knysna, Plettenberg Bay &amp; Port Elizabeth are the most popular – each offer something special.
Wildlife seekers should add a Big 5 safari to their Garden Route holiday. The nearby Eastern Cape offers plenty of wonderful family-friendly options as well as luxurious lodges for couples or honeymooners.

#### Activities
Our Guide to the Best of the Garden Route, South Africa hails this beautiful area as a long-time favourite for family holidays. The Garden Route offers a wide range of unforgettable African adventures like tree canopy tours, elephant encounters, sailing, hiking, climbing &amp; visiting monkey &amp; bird wildlife sanctuaries.
Guests who are looking for a more relaxed Garden Route itinerary and holiday can spend their days basking in the sun at one of the blue flag beaches, play a round of golf – several of South Africa’s best golf courses are found here - or indulge in fresh seafood at an ocean-view restaurant.

#### When to travel
The Garden Route has an all-year-round temperate climate that is perfectly suited to an outdoor lifestyle. The best time to travel is in summer (between November &amp; April) when temperatures are at their highest.
Winters can be cold &amp; wet, but temperatures rarely drop below 16 degrees Celsius &amp; during this time hiking &amp; whale watching are at their best.
