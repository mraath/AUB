# Dock House
## Cape Town
### Dock House

#### Experience
With a prime location in the heart of Cape Town’s V&amp;A Waterfont, Dock House provides the perfect base from which to explore the city – while still maintaining the highest level of luxury &amp; service.
Originally the Harbor Master’s 1800’s home, Dock House combines classic Victorian architecture with contemporary style.  The boutique offers only 6 suites &amp; 24-hour butler service, both adding to the intimate &amp; personal atmosphere.
Within walking distance, you will find some of Cape Town’s best restaurants, boutique shops &amp; cafes – as well as the harbour with its many yachts &amp; boats.  With Table Mountain as the backdrop, guests will be right at the centre of all Cape Town’s top attractions.

#### Stay
Accommodation comprises 5 luxury rooms &amp; 1 luxury suite.
Each luxury room has been individually styled, but all share equal amounts of sophistication.  Three of the upstairs rooms have balconies with views of the bustling harbour at the V&amp;A Waterfront &amp; the ground floor room opens onto a veranda overlooking the groomed garden &amp; swimming pool area.
One set of these rooms are inter-leading, making them an ideal choice for families.
The luxury suite is exceptionally opulent &amp; opens up to a private, beautifully manicured courtyard garden.
Hotel facilities include a wellness spa, manicured gardens beside a sparkling swimming pool, a state-of-the-art fitness centre as well as a restaurant &amp; bar.  Childminding services are available for those travelling with children.

#### Activities
There is a never-ending list of things to do in Cape Town – from visiting Cape Town’s best beaches, shopping at the V&amp;A Waterfront &amp; wine-tasting in the Cape Winelands to spending time with the adorable penguins at Boulders Beach or having a picnic in Kirstenbosch Gardens.
Other options like shark-cage diving or whale watching can also be arranged.
