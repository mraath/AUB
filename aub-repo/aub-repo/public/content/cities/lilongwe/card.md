### Lilongwe

#### Experience
Sprawling, vibrant &amp; bustling with commerce, Malawi’s capital may lack Blantyre’s charm but soon grows on visitors.
Most visitors to Malawi come to see beautiful Lake Malawi, the game-rich Liwonde National Park &amp; the scenic Majete Wildlife Reserve - Lilongwe's must-visit places.
Lilongwe is an ideal overnight destination for guests wishing to recover from jet lag before embarking on a Malawi safari or for those who need to stay over to catch a connecting flight the following day.
Accommodation for tourists is usually found in leafy neighbourhoods – a lovely haven, away from the hustle &amp; bustle of city life.

#### Activities
Lilongwe is home to a small wildlife sanctuary – the Lilongwe Wildlife Centre – that is set in a stunning 180-hectare nature reserve. It is renowned as one of the best wildlife sanctuaries in Africa &amp; is home to around 200 rescued animals at any one time.
Guests can also dine at one of Lilongwe’s top restaurants or shop at a local market – an interesting, cultural experience.
