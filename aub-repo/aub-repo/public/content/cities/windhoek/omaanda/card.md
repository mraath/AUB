### Omaanda

#### Experience
Omaanda is a unique lodge located within a private nature reserve a short drive from Windhoek’s Hosea Kutako International &amp; Eros Domestic Airports.
Omaanda is the ideal stop-over before or after a Namibia safari &amp; especially an ideal choice for guests who are looking for a nature-based stay, away from the city’s hustle &amp; bustle.
Set in a 9,000-hectare Namibian wilderness, guests will have privileged access to a conservation reserve that offers incredible wildlife viewing &amp; an authentic, local experience.

#### Stay
There are 10 air-conditioned thatched chalets at Omaanda, each modelled on local Owambo huts &amp; featuring en-suite bathrooms.
Two of these chalets are larger &amp; can sleep up to 6 guests, making them ideal for families.
The lodge has a traditional feel but is modern in design – offering world-class facilities such as Wi-Fi, a Bluetooth television in each room, a heated pool &amp; a wellness spa.
The main lodge is home to an open-sided lounge, bar &amp; dining area as well as an outdoor deck with a heated swimming pool &amp; sun loungers offering spectacular views over the hills &amp; mountains.

#### Activities
Guests staying at Omaanda can enjoy game drives, leopard-, elephant- or rhino- tracking, sunrise meerkat visits or spending time with orphaned or injured animals at the Shiloh Wildlife Sanctuary.
