### Victoria Falls

#### Experience
No one has ever wondered why the Victoria Falls is listed as one of the only Seven Natural Wonders of the World.
The local people call it Mosi-oa-Tunya, “The smoke that thunders,” because something magnificent happens when the river is high  &amp; the spray towers in the air while water gushes down like falling thunder.
The Victoria Falls is 1,708 meters wide  &amp; with an average of 550,000 cubic meters of water plummeting over the edge every minute, it is by far the largest curtain of water in the world. Visitors travel from all around the globe to catch a glimpse of this spectacular sighting.
The Victoria Falls is set between Zimbabwe &amp; Zambia, making it accessible to view from both sides (visa obtained upon arrival). Guests can also easily combine a Victoria Falls adventure with a safari to Hwange, Mana Pools or Botswana for a well-rounded African holiday. Inquire with us to find out all you need to know before going to Victoria Falls and the surrounding attractions, we can plan out the perfect itinerary for adventure and relaxation!

#### Activities
Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe is also known as Africa’s adventure capital  &amp; offers something for every type of traveler. Highlights include scenic helicopter flights, sunset boat cruises on the Zambezi River  &amp; guided tours to the majestic Victoria Falls.
Adrenaline junkies tend to fill up their days with action-packed activities such as river rafting, bungee jumping, micro-lighting  &amp; canoeing. There is also fun for the whole family. Elephant-back safaris are usually an all-time favorite amongst little adventurers.
If you are feeling adventurous, why not go for a swim at the edge of The Falls? (season dependent) Devil’s Pool at Livingstone Island has a good reputation &amp; never fails to impress thrill-seekers or Insta-lovers.

#### When to travel
If you’re planning a trip to Victoria Falls, the best time to visit is during ‘High Water’ season - from February to July, directly after the region's summer rains, when you'll see the world's largest sheet of falling water flowing at its greatest volume.
‘Low Water’ runs between August &amp; January &amp;is at its lowest between November &amp; early December. This is the time when there is very little spray, but river rafting &amp;swimming at Devil’s Pool are both wonderful activities to experience during low season. Whenever you visit, the Victoria Falls attractions and activities will keep you mesmerised!
