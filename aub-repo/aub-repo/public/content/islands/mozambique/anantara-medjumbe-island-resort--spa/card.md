### Anantara Medjumbe Island Resort & Spa

#### Experience
Anantara Medjumbe Island Resort is located on its own remote island in the magnificent Quirimbas Archipelago in Northern Mozambique.  
Medjume is the ultimate island retreat, offering romantic beachfront accommodation, private plunge pools, fresh seafood directly from the ocean, exciting water sports &amp; excellent service.
So secluded, Medjumbe can only be reached by small aircraft &amp; therefore ensures an unspoilt, pristine beach experience.  
The island enjoys some of the most breathtaking coral reefs in Mozambique, which means that diving &amp; snorkelling excursions are simply breathtaking.

#### Stay
There are 12 palm-thatched beach pool villas dotted along the beach.  These villas are sophisticated, yet simple &amp; offer everything you need for a relaxing island getaway.  
Each villa has direct access to the beach &amp; features an oceanfront deck with a private plunge pool &amp; cabana overlooking the ocean as well as an en-suite bathroom with an indoor &amp; outdoor shower.  
Outside on the deck, a hammock welcomes you to pick up a book or a cocktail &amp; relax.
At the main area, you will find many decks &amp; shaded verandas, creating private spots for relaxing.  Upstairs is home to an informal lounge with magnificent views over the ocean.
Delicious seafood cuisine is served indoors in the dining area &amp; outside on the deck by candlelight.

#### Activities
At Medjumbe Island Resort, hours can be spent lounging on the beach, enjoying gorgeous views &amp; dipping in the Indian Ocean’s turquoise waters.  
For those in search of more activity, a range of exciting water sports is available, such as snorkelling, scuba diving, windsurfing, fishing, waterskiing, kayaking, sailing &amp; dhow excursions.
