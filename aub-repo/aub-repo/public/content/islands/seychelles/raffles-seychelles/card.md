### Raffles Seychelles

#### Experience
Raffles Seychelles is set on a hillside on the famous Praslin Island &amp; overlook Anse Tamake, a beautiful expanse of white sand &amp; turquoise waters.
The Seychelles is home to 115 islands, of which Praslin has been referred to in the past by the early explorers as ‘the Garden of Eden.’
The island is home to incredible flora &amp; fauna, including the forest of Vallee de Mai &amp; the islands of Curieuse &amp; La Digue.  These nearby islands are famous for their populations of giant turtles &amp; also offer spectacular snorkelling &amp; diving sites.
Only 5 minutes away by boat, you will find Anse Lazio – considered one of the Top 5 beaches in the world.  Raffles Seychelles can be reached within 15 minutes by plane or helicopter from Mahe Island, or a scenic 55 minutes by ferry.

Each villa features a private outdoor pavilion, plunge pool &amp; balcony to soak up breathtaking views of the ocean, white sandy beach &amp; lush green hills.  
Some villas are set high up on the hill, some are closer to the beach &amp; others offer peace &amp; tranquillity overlooking the garden.  The more luxurious options are one &amp; two-bedroom villas, offering ultimate space &amp; privacy.
