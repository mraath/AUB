### Madagascar

#### Experience
Madagascar is an island country in the Indian Ocean, situated off the coast of East Africa across the Mozambique Channel. It’s an island in Africa you don’t want to miss!
At 593,000 sq km, Madagascar is the world’s second-largest island country &amp; the 4th largest island in the world.
It is a hotspot for biodiversity – with remote islands, pristine beaches, lush rainforests as well as canyons &amp; semi-deserts, this island country offers guests a unique, off-the-beaten-track holiday experience.
The capital, Antananarivo, oozes history &amp; here guests can visit beautiful palaces, lush gardens &amp; bustling flea markets while Madagascar’s luxurious islands offer virgin beaches with crystal clear water as well as exciting water &amp; land-based sports - including diving, snorkelling, kayaking, paddleboarding, sailing, fishing, hiking &amp; nature walks.
Boat trips to see dolphins, manta rays &amp; whales are also a popular activity that should not be missed. The island is also home to interesting wildlife, such as lemurs, birds &amp; reptiles.

#### Stay
Antananarivo, the capital of Madagascar offers a variety of boutique hotels &amp; modern city hotels for an authentic, down-to-earth overnight stay. Guests heading to the beach can choose from luxurious island retreats, romantic beach huts &amp; private villas.

#### When to travel
The best time to visit Madagascar is between April to November. This is Madagascar's dry season, when the weather is good &amp; nights are mild.
The wet season lasts from December to March and is characterized by heavy rainfall &amp; hot, humid temperatures. This can make it harder to explore the country's forests. January &amp; February in particular - are very wet, with many lodges shutting their doors for this period.
If it's the country’s iconic lemurs you’d like to see, the best time to visit Madagascar is all year round! But breeding generally occurs between October to December. Humpback whales can be seen off the coast in July &amp; August.
Bird watching is best in August &amp; September.
