# Maison Gallieni
## Madagascar
### Maison Gallieni

#### Experience
The classic red-brick Maison Gallieni was built in 1879 on the site of an old granary &amp; used to house Madagascar’s first bank.
Set on a hill overlooking Antananarivo, the hotel shares a building with the Monaco Consulate in the historic heart of the Malagasy capital.
Arguably the best hotel in the city, Maison Gallieni is a sophisticated &amp; contemporary haven for the discerning traveller looking for a luxurious overnight stay on the island.

#### Stay
Small &amp; intimate, the hotel boasts only 4 individually decorated en-suite rooms with high ceilings, occasional antiques &amp; mid-century pieces.
Maison Gallieni features a heated swimming pool banked by a lush vertical garden &amp; a large veranda where delicious breakfasts are served.

#### Activities
Guests can enjoy sightseeing tours to the Queen’s Palace, Lake Anosy, Lemur Park, Botanical Gardens &amp; Andafiavaratra Palace or visit one of the nearby flea markets.
Back at the hotel, they can savour delicious 3-course meals that can be ordered in advance or enjoy relaxing in-room massages.
