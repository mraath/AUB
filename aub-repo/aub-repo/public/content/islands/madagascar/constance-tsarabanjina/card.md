### Constance Tsarabanjina

#### Experience
Set on Tsarabanjina, a small private island in the north-western Mitsio Archipelago in Madagascar lies Constance Tsarabanjina – a luxury island retreat surrounded by powder-soft beaches, lush tropical vegetation &amp; rich coral reefs.
This eco-friendly resort overlooks the renowned scuba-diving location:  Les Quatre Freres (The Four Brothers), four islets of silver basalt rocks that is home to a variety of colourful fish &amp; other sea creatures.
With a laid-back atmosphere, this barefoot chic retreat offers an unspoilt Robinson Crusoe-like island experience in one of Madagascar’s most remote &amp; pristine locations.
Here guests can feast on fresh seafood &amp; Malagasy specialities or enjoy the ocean views from their private hammock.
