## Our Clients Say
### Sabi Sand Safari

We had a great time on safari, thanks to Liselle! Arathusa Safari Lodge was brilliant - especially with the waterhole full! We saw wild dogs, leopards & a cub as well as many lions & plenty of other wildlife. 
The staff were brilliant & we will all certainly go back. Our stay in Camps Bay was also fantastic!
Thanks again, Liselle & Africa Unwind!
Regards,
Andy Dwyer
