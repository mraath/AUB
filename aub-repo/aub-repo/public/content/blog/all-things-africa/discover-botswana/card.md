It is easy to fall in love in Africa…The romance of the bush is unlike any other. And Botswana is first in line when it comes to remoteness, luxurious tented camps & superb game viewing.


Whether you’re planning a romantic getaway or looking for a family friendly environment to soak up the African sun, here’s why we think Botswana should be at the top of your list:


#### Botswana Beauty: Find inspiration & joy


One of the reasons we love Botswana, is its natural beauty. The country is home to a diverse array of wildlife, including elephants, lions, & hippos. The country's untouched wilderness & vast landscapes are utterly peaceful & awe-inspiring.


#### Botswana Safaris: The very best in wildlife


Botswana is serious about wildlife & conservation, with 38% of its total land area designated to wildlife management areas, national parks & reserves. This means that the safaris are unparalleled. With the chance to visit the world-renowned Moremi Game Reserve or the beautiful Okavango Delta with its maze of lagoons, channels & islands, you’ll have plenty of opportunities to spot the Big Five. Witness large herds of elephants in Chobe National Park, meet the meerkats of the Makgadikgadi Pans or go on walking safaris with a San bushman in the Kalahari.


#### Botswana Romance: The far-flung magnificence of the bush


Meno a Kwena, the understated luxury safari lodge of choice for the Royal couple, sits atop a cliff overlooking the Boteti River. While you may think it’s reserved for couples alone, here’s a little secret; it’s absolutely perfect for families too! Meno a Kwena offers luxurious tents to suit travellers of every kind, be it in twin tents, king tents or family tents. Whatever your choice, you get to experience the best in “armchair game viewing" as you look out over the Boteti River when it attracts animals, large & small, during the dry season. Add to your stay a walking safari with the Ju! Hoansi Bushman clan, or a sleep-out under the stars in the Makgadikgadi Pans. 


#### Botswana Tours: Land, air or water - you’ll enjoy them all


Looking for the best Botswana safari? Hop into an open-air 4x4 vehicle in search of the wild & wonderful or weave through the channels of the Okavango Delta in a dugout canoe called a mokoro. And because Botswana is tantalisingly remote, you’ll even get the chance to board a small plane in pursuit of your next destination - aerial game viewing will leave you wanting more. 


Botswana offers a year-round invitation to experience something spectacular. Whatever your itinerary, the spirit of adventure is alive & well in Botswana. Its diverse wildlife, untouched wilderness, & commitment to conservation make it a must-visit destination for any nature lover.

##### WHAT TYPE OF SAFARI ACTIVITIES DOES BOTSWANA OFFER?

The list is endless! Botswana offers both land & water-based safari activities.

Some safari lodges even offer helicopter flights over the Delta.

The best time to visit Botswana for wildlife viewing is during the dry season, from May to October. That's when the animals gather around water sources, making it easier for you to spot them. Plus, the vegetation is less dense, giving you a clearer view.

Most visitors to Botswana need a visa, except for citizens of a few countries who enjoy visa-free entry.
