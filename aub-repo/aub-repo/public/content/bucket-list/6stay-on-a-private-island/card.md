### 6Stay On a Private Island

STAY ON A PRIVATE ISLAND
Nothing screams luxury quite like private island living.  And Africa’s Indian Ocean offers you a selection of private islands, each boasting pristine beaches, crystal-clear water &amp; total exclusivity. 
A magnet for discerning travellers – romantics, honeymooners &amp; even families – a private island holiday is the perfect way to relax.  Snorkel, dive, swim, eat fresh seafood, get relaxing massages &amp; enjoy a wide selection of water sports.  
Apart from the fact that private islands allow for total exclusivity, (no other resorts are found on the island) you can enjoy unspoilt beaches, untouched coral reefs &amp; even private butler services.
This is luxury at its best.
Want to experience the best of both worlds?  Why not combine an African safari with an Indian Ocean holiday – &amp; experience your own slice of paradise?
