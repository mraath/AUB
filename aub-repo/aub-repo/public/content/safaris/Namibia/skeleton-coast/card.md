### Skeleton Coast

#### Experience
Namibia boasts a mystifying stretch of coastline, scattered with the ghosts of shipwrecks, extending from Swakopmund to the Angolan border. It's a place that has earned its enigmatic name – the Skeleton Coast.
Once a graveyard for ill-fated sailors whose vessels succumbed to the Atlantic's treacherous currents, ever-shifting sandbanks, and thick fog, the Skeleton Coast now stands as one of Namibia's most remote and captivating regions, promising surprises at every turn.
This untouched coastline unfolds with spectacular vistas that seamlessly blend desert, ocean, &amp sky. Here, nature's artwork paints the scene, &amp you'll encounter nearly 250 species of birds soaring through the azure sky. While exploring freshwater seeps, you might come across antelope species like gemsbok, kudu, &amp springbok, occasionally joined by the remarkable desert-adapted elephants.
However, the most dramatic spectacle awaits at Cape Cross, where an astonishing 80,000 to 100,000 Cape fur seals call home. During the breeding season, between November &amp December, the shores welcome as many as 200,000 seals. It's also a prime time to witness predators like the brown hyena &amp black-backed jackal seizing opportunities in this dynamic ecosystem.

#### Activities
The Skeleton Coast is a treasure trove of unique and thrilling safari activities. Set off on scenic flights to seek out bleached whale bones &amp shipwrecks, revealing the maritime history that has shaped this coastline. Additionally, immerse yourself in the rich culture of the region with trips to meet the nomadic Himba people, renowned for their use of reddish-brown powder mixed with butter for their distinctive appearance.
For those seeking adventure, 4x4 drives lead you to encounters with desert-adapted wildlife, while day trips offer opportunities to witness the astounding Cape fur seal colonies &amp the Suiderkruis Shipwreck. As the day draws to a close, embark on sundowner drives to the resplendent, roaring sand dunes of the Namib Desert.
The thrill-seekers among us can partake in dune boarding and quad bike excursions, or simply savor romantic beachfront lunches amidst this natural wonderland.

#### When to travel
While Skeleton Coast welcomes visitors year-round, the optimal time to experience its wonders is during the warmer months from October to March. These months bring occasional rains that clear the skies, resulting in less morning fog and milder nighttime temperatures compared to the winter season.
Intriguing and untamed, Namibia's Skeleton Coast invites you to uncover its secrets, from the haunting shipwrecks &amp bountiful wildlife to cultural encounters with the Himba people &amp thrilling desert adventures. Explore this coastal wonderland for an unforgettable journey that promises both mystery&amp marvel.
