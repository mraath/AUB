### Hoanib Skeleton Coast Camp

#### Experience
In this very remote part of Namibia’s Skeleton Coast – known for its vast plains, dry riverbeds, haunting shipwrecks &amp; desert-adapted wildlife – lies Hoanib Skeleton Coast Camp.
The Skeleton Coast attracts adventure-seekers who are looking for a unique &amp; off-the-beaten-track safari experience.  
The area is home to the oldest living desert plant in the world – at 2,000 years: the preternatural welwitschias &amp; guests can visit the semi-nomadic Himba people who still live in this rugged desert terrain.

#### Stay
There are 7 luxury tents at Hoanib Skeleton Coast Camp as well as a 2-bedroom family tent comprising of 2 bedrooms.
All tents have en-suite facilities &amp; shaded decks offering beautiful views over the desert.
The main lodge includes a lounge &amp; dining area as well as a bar, library &amp; swimming pool where lazy afternoons are usually spent.

#### Activities
The Hoanib River is the major source of food for desert-dwelling creatures, including giraffe, cheetah &amp; springbok.  
Activities at Hoanib includes open 4x4 game drives in search of desert-adapted wildlife &amp; guided walking safaris with a focus on smaller animals &amp; interesting plants.
