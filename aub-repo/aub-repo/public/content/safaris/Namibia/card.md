## SAFARIS
### Namibia

#### Experience
Namibia lies between the Kalahari & the Atlantic Ocean & offers its visitors dramatic, untouched scenery, beautiful stargazing & excellent photographic opportunities.
It is of course the impressive & incomparable red sand dunes of the Namib Desert that feature most on a Namibia safari itinerary. You can enjoy scenic hot air balloon flights over Sossusvlei’s dunes, go quad biking or even take a hike up to the much-photographed Dune 45 for breathtaking views.
Further stops should also include the mystical, shipwreck-strewn Skeleton Coast with its large Cape Fur seal colonies, the rugged & wild Damaraland where you will look for desert-adapted elephants in open 4x4 jeeps, the culturally rich Kunene region: home to the Himba people, & the game-packed Etosha National Park with its superb Big 5 wildlife encounters.
Etosha is famous for its many waterholes that are scattered throughout the park – a well-watered answer to thirsty animals. Namibia has decent infrastructure & easy-to-access destinations, which means that you can enjoy luxurious fly-in safaris or rent a car & explore the country at your own pace.

#### Stay
Luxurious lodges are tucked away in some of Namibia’s most remote regions. The country offers accommodation for all types of travellers – including exclusive, romantic hideaways, family-friendly lodges & luxury tented camps for the adventurous traveller.
Since Namibia is all about dramatic scenery & open spaces – most lodges have been designed to enhance the beautiful views.

#### When to travel
The best time to visit Namibia is in the dry season from June to October, although it can be visited throughout the year. If you’re looking for great wildlife viewing, the best time to visit Namibia for a safari is in the dry season, this is true for all parks, but particularly for Etosha. The climate is generally dry & pleasant no matter which winter month you travel to Namibia.
Between December & March, days can be humid & rain may follow, often in localized, afternoon thunderstorms. In the wet season, animals move away from the waterholes & scatter around the park.
