### Etosha National Park

#### Experience
Etosha National Park, spanning 23,000 square km, stands tall as one of Africa's top wildlife destinations. This haven is celebrated for its simplicity, safety, &amp rich game-viewing experiences in Southern Africa.
Within Etosha's boundaries resides the famed Big 5—lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo, &amp rhino, alongside the elusive cheetah &amp a myriad of other wildlife. Photographers find paradise here, thanks to numerous game-packed waterholes, where the wildlife spectacle never ends. With the flexibility of self-drive access, couples, honeymooners, &amp families can explore Namibia at their pace, culminating their journey with a safari in this premier wildlife destination.

#### Activities
Etosha caters to diverse safari interests. Open 4x4 game drives &amp guided nature walks top the list. Witnessing waterhole gatherings is an unmissable highlight, with some camps offering photographic hides for close encounters with passing wildlife.

#### When to travel
Etosha beckons visitors year-round, yet the prime season aligns with the dry winter months, from July to October. During this period, wildlife congregates around diminished water sources, enhancing your game-viewing opportunities. From December to March, occasional humid days &amp afternoon thunderstorms grace the wet season. Wildlife disperses across the park as waterholes are less essential during this time.
