### Little Ongava

#### Experience
Little Ongava is one of Namibia’s most luxurious &amp; exclusive safari camps.  Built on a rocky outcrop in the Ongava Game Reserve to the south of Etosha, the lodge provides awe-inspiring views over the reserve.
The Etosha National Park is one of Africa’s largest game parks &amp; boasts a variety of wildlife &amp; large herds of plains game.  The elusive black rhino can also be found here.

#### Stay
Little Ongava, as the name suggests, consists of only 3 spacious, luxurious &amp; private suites.  Here guests will experience remote exclusivity like nowhere else in the country.
Each suite features a private plunge pool, a sala &amp; an en suite bathroom with both indoor &amp; outdoor showers for those wishing to get closer to nature.  The bath has a magnificent view over the surrounding reserve.  
The main lodge consists of a dining &amp; lounge area, both looking out over the waterhole below.

#### Activities
Excellent photographic opportunities can be enjoyed from the 4x4 game drive vehicle or animal hide overlooking the waterhole.  
Frequent sightings of lion, elephant, gemsbok, springbok, red hartebeest &amp; white &amp; black rhino can be expected.  For the adventurous at heart - white rhino can also be tracked on foot.
