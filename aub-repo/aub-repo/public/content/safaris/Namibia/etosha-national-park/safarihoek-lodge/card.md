# Safarihoek Lodge
## Etosha National Park
### Safarihoek Lodge

#### Experience
Set on a hill in the exclusive Etosha Heights Private Reserve, bordering the world-renowned Etosha National Park, lies Safarihoek Lodge.
With uninterrupted views of the rugged yet beautiful landscape &amp; roaming wildlife, Safarihoek Lodge is a favourite among many travellers.
Here, it is all about the views - &amp; wildlife, of course!  From every corner of the lodge – including the swimming pool, chalet &amp; dining area – Etosha’s unspoilt beauty is showcased.
A highlight to Safarihoek is the nearby double story hide overlooking a waterhole where wildlife enthusiasts love to get up-close &amp; personal with some of their favourite animals.

#### Stay
Accommodation consists of 2 classic chalets, 8 luxury chalets &amp; a 2-bedroom family chalet – all raised high above the savanna on wooden platforms.
Beautiful views of the bush &amp; animals can be enjoyed from the chalets’ private decks.
Each chalet features an en-suite bathroom with an indoor shower (the luxury chalets also have outdoor showers) as well as air-conditioning.
The central area of the camp comprises a large lounge area, wine cellar, dining room &amp; wooden deck where al fresco dinners are served.  There is also a cosy outdoor seating area complete with crackling fire as well as a bar &amp; swimming pool with infinite views of the plains below.

#### Activities
Activities at Safarihoek include open 4x4 game drives, night drives in search of nocturnal animals, walking safaris where guests can learn more about local fauna &amp; flora as well as vulture feeding.  
The plains below Safarihoek Lodge are the man-made feeding grounds for the surrounding array of vultures – one of their conservation contributions as they form a buffer zone between Etosha &amp; the surrounding farmers.
Excellent photographic opportunities can be enjoyed from the comfort of the lodge’s hide overlooking the waterhole.
