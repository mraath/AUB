In the middle of the bush in Etosha’s Onguma Game Reserve, you will find Onguma Bush Camp – renowned for its excellent waterhole game viewing &amp; family-friendly safaris.
The reserve covers an area of over 34,000 hectares of savanna, bushveld &amp; dry pan, offering over 30 different animal species.  Plains game roam freely on the reserve &amp; predators are common residents in the area.
