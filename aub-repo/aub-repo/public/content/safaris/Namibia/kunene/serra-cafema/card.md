### Serra Cafema

#### Experience
Serra Cafema, one of Southern Africa's most remote camps, is located within the far north-west corner of Namibia in an area known as the Kunene region.
Located on the Kunene River, the region's only water source – Serra Cafema enjoys sensational views of the lush green riverbanks.  
The camp is only reachable by small plane (3 hours from Windhoek), making this a stylish off-the-beaten-track safari destination.

#### Stay
Serra Cafema is an intimate camp consisting of 8 riverside Meru-style canvas &amp; thatched tented villas built on elevated decks.  One of these tents is a family unit consisting of 2 en-suite bedrooms.  
Each tent features an en suite bathroom with an indoor &amp; outdoor shower, an expansive wooden deck with a dining area, a hammock &amp; a comfortable bench with breathtaking river views.  
The Serra Cafema 'Ozonganda,' or main area, comprises indoor &amp; outdoor dining areas, a sunken lounge, library &amp; swimming pool, all sharing views of the beautiful Kunene River.

#### Activities
Guests can enjoy informative nature drives &amp; carefully guided quad bike excursions through the fragile dunes to have a true Namib Desert experience. 
 
Boating on the Kunene River is always exciting.  Frequent sightings of crocodiles &amp; waterbirds can be expected in this surreal, lunar-like landscape.    
Guided nature walks &amp; visits to the local Himba villages in the Hartmann's Valley are often the highlights of a trip to the Kunene region.
Picnic lunches to the Marienfluss Valley can also be arranged.
