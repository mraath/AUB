### Kunene

#### Experience
Nestled in northern Namibia, bordering Angola, the Kunene region beckons adventurers with its remote, untouched allure, almost isolated by its rugged terrain—a pristine jewel among Africa's safari destinations.
Kunene's remoteness is a defining feature, accessible solely by small aircraft, captivating travelers seeking a genuinely secluded &amp uncrowded safari. Amidst an otherwise harsh, arid landscape, the Kunene River carves an oasis-like haven, drawing nomadic wildlife from afar. This refuge boasts two remarkable waterfalls: Epupa, cascading against unique rock walls, &amp Ruacana, one of Africa's widest &amp most voluminous waterfalls. Amid this enchanting backdrop reside the Himba tribe, a unique people who lead a nomadic lifestyle &amp are known for their distinctive full-body skin treatment, safeguarding them from the African sun &amp adorning them in rich red hues.

#### Activities
Kunene offers diverse land and water-based activities, including dune excursions and responsible cultural encounters with the Himba people. These encounters may reveal the nomadic desert existence &amp survival strategies in this otherworldly landscape. Nature drives, hiking, quad biking, Kunene River boating safaris, &amp scenic desert picnics are also on the menu. Additionally, guests can partake in rafting, canoeing, fishing, swimming in rock pools, &amp bird watching.

#### When to travel
Kunene welcomes travelers year-round, with the most pleasant climate gracing the winter months from May to September. For an awe-inspiring spectacle, plan your visit in March, April, or May, when Epupa and Ruacana Falls roar with thunderous volumes of water, creating mesmerizing mist clouds near their bases.
Kunene, where solitude meets adventure, &amp nature's wonders captivate the soul.
