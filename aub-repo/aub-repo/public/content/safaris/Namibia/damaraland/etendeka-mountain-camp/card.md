## Damaraland
### Etendeka Mountain Camp

#### Experience
Amidst the raw &amp; natural beauty of dramatic Damaraland in Namibia, lies Etendeka Mountain Camp.
Rugged &amp; untouched Damaraland is a place of dramatic boulders, beautiful mountains &amp; an abundance of wildlife like African wildcats, aardwolves, mountain zebras &amp; even the Big 5. 
The small &amp; intimate Etendeka Mountain Camp is popular among adventure-seekers who are looking for a special, off-the-beaten-track safari experience.

#### Stay
With only 10 Meru-style tents, Etendeka offers spectacular views over the desert landscape &amp; grazing wildlife.
Each tent has a private patio &amp; an en-suite bathroom with an open-air bucket shower, flush toilet &amp; solar-heated water.
The main lodge area consists of a lounge, dining room, bar &amp; swimming pool – a favourite among travellers during the warm summer months.

#### Activities
Activities at Etendeka Mountain Camp include walking safaris in search of smaller animals like elephant shrew or black mongoose, or via open 4x4 to seek out black rhino, desert-adapted elephant, herds of sword-horned oryx &amp; cheetah.  
At night, your hosts will point out some of the more interesting constellations, stars &amp; planets with the aid of a ‘star pointer’ &amp; a telescope.  There are no other camps for miles &amp; air pollution is minimal, so star gazing in Namibia is a privilege to experience.
Birdwatching is also a popular activity at Etendeka.
