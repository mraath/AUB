#### Experience
Mowani Mountain Camp, as the name suggests, is perched on a high rock between a crescent of mountains in the Twyfelfontein Conservancy in Namibia.
This remote desert area is known for its frequent sightings of the rare black rhino &amp; the elusive desert elephant, making this one of Africa's most exciting safari destinations.

#### Stay
Mowani offers 12 view rooms (4 superior view rooms, 3 view rooms &amp; 5 standard rooms), 1 luxury room &amp; 2 suites.  All rooms have en-suite facilities.
The view rooms are built between large granite boulders &amp; offer uninterrupted views, private decks &amp; open-air bathrooms.
The luxury room boasts a private deck overlooking the valley.  It is situated close to the lodge &amp; is ideal for guests who are not too mobile.
The 2 suites have spectacular wrap-around views, private lounges, dining &amp; bar facilities where drinks are included.  A personal waiter will attend to guests’ needs &amp; requirements upon request.  These suites also feature outdoor bush baths &amp; showers with beautiful views over the desert.
The main area at Mowani Mountain Camp comprises a lounge, bar &amp; pool.

#### Activities
There are plenty of ways to relax at Mowani Mountain Camp.  Safari activities include game drives, guided nature drives in search of the elusive desert elephant &amp; black rhino, hiking through magnificent scenery or relaxing by the pool while soaking up the sun.
