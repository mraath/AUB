## Mana Pools National Park
### Nyamatusi Camp

#### Experience
Nestled between a grove of large mahogany &amp; sausage trees lies Nyamatusi Camp – one of Mana Pool National Park’s most luxurious safari camps.
With air-conditioning &amp; private plunge pools in every suite, guests can experience this wildlife-rich area in style, while still adhering to an eco-friendly &amp; sustainable design.
Mana Pools’ complex ecosystem supports a wealth of game, including cheetah, wild dog, lion &amp; leopard, which makes this area attractive to safari enthusiasts.  
Because the Zambezi River’s banks swell during the summer rains, Nyamatusi is a seasonal camp that only operates between April &amp; November – the best time to go on safari!

#### Stay
 
Boasting 6 spacious tented suites, Nyamatusi Camp is small &amp; intimate – offering a remote safari experience in a pristine wilderness setting.
Each of the suites has uninterrupted views of the Zambezi River &amp; includes an en-suite bathroom with indoor &amp; outdoor shower, air-conditioning, a pilates mat &amp; weights as well as a private deck with a plunge pool where lazy days are spent.
The double-story main area features a library, dining room, bar &amp; viewing deck with splash pool.

#### Activities
Nyamatusi Camp has a variety of exciting safari activities on the menu.  Some of these include open 4x4 game drives, walking safaris &amp; catch-&amp;-release fishing.
The Lower Zambezi River is the ideal setting for an adventurous canoe safari.  Guests can paddle along the tranquil waters &amp; look for wildlife such as hippos, crocodiles, elephants &amp; a variety of birds.
