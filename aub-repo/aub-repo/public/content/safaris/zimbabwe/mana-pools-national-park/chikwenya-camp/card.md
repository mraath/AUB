### Chikwenya Camp

#### Experience
The seasonal Chikweyna Camp (open April to November) enjoys an idyllic location in an exclusive-use area in one of Zimbabwe’s prime wildlife regions:  Mana Pools National Park.
With jaw-dropping views of the Zambezi River, its floodplains &amp; the distant mountains of the Rift Valley escarpment, photographers often feel like they are in ‘wildlife paradise.’

#### Stay
Chikweyna Camp boasts 5 tented suites &amp; 2 family suites, each featuring an en-suite bathroom with an indoor &amp; outdoor shower as well as an indoor bath.
Each tented suite includes a veranda &amp; private outdoor sunken deck with comfortable outdoor sofas where relaxing afternoons can be spent.  
Each of the 2 family suites has a private plunge pool – the ideal place for children to swim &amp; play between safari activities.
The main lodge area also has a larger swimming pool &amp; bar serving delicious cocktails.

#### Activities
Chikwenya guests can enjoy exclusive access to a beautiful stretch of the Zambezi River, the nearby Sapi River &amp; Chickweyna Island on game drives &amp; guided walking safaris.
Large herds of buffaloes &amp; elephants are frequently seen in this area, as well as healthy populations of hippo, lion, wild dog, leopard &amp; zebra.
