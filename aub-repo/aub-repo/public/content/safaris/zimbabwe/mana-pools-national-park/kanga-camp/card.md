#### Experience
The seasonal Kanga Camp (only open from May – October) is set in a crowd-free private concession within one of Zimbabwe’s prime wildlife regions:  Mana Pools National Park.
Kanga Camp offers guests an authentic, adventurous safari experience with a touch of luxury.  
The camp overlooks the Kanga Pan – a regular watering point for wildlife – ensuring superb ‘armchair’ wildlife viewing from the comfort of the viewing deck.
Mana Pools is home to the Big 5 – lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo &amp; rhino – as well as a variety of other game &amp; birds.  For a thrilling, up-close-&amp;-personal safari experience, look no further than Kanga Camp!
Mana Pools is a fly-in destination that can easily be combined with a trip to Victoria Falls.

Each Meru-styled tent boasts floor-to-ceiling mesh windows &amp; is complete with an en-suite bathroom, outdoor shower &amp; a secluded veranda.
The family or honeymoon tent boasts a wraparound terrace facing the pan with private seating &amp; dining areas.  A roll-top bath on the adjoining secluded deck is ideal for a romantic starlit bath.
