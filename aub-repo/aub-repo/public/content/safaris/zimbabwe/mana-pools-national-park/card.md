# Mana Pools National Park
## Zimbabwe
### Mana Pools National Park

#### Experience
In the Shona language, the word ‘mana’ means ‘four.’ And aptly so, because Mana Pools National Park earned its name from the 4 large pools that were formed by the changing course of the relentless Zambezi River.
These iconic pools have become a magnet for an impressive amount of wildlife such as elephants, buffalos, zebras, warthogs, impalas & baboons that flock to the pool’s lush banks for food while predators such as lions, leopards, cheetahs & hyenas are not far behind.
A UNESCO World Heritage Site, Mana Pools National Park is one of Africa’s prime wildlife destinations & not only delivers exceptional game viewing but has a bird list of 350 recorded species.
As a fly-in destination, Mana Pools can be easily reached from Victoria Falls or Hwange, so travellers can have a well-rounded Zimbabwe safari experience.

#### Activities
The Zambezi River makes it possible for guests to enjoy both land & water-based safari activities in Mana Pools.
These include traditional open 4x4 game drives, as well as exclusive guided walks in Zimbabwe and river-based safaris which include a mix of kayaking, boating, fishing, & wildlife fly camping safaris.

#### When to travel
The best time for birdwatching and wildlife viewing in Mana Pools National Park is during the dry season, from June to October. Animals are easier to spot because the dry weather thins the bush & wildlife concentrates around the Zambezi River & the pools on its floodplains.
During the rainy season from late November to April, a completely different park emerges from that of the dry season. Parched savannahs turn into lush fields with an abundance of grazing. Many animals disperse inland & game viewing becomes limited, although resident animals do remain. During the green season, newly born animals can be seen & the birdlife is prolific.
Note that access by road is often limited between December & March.
