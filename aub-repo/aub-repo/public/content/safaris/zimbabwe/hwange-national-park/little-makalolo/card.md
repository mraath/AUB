#### Experience
Little Makalolo is a luxury tented safari camp with a firm focus on wildlife that lies in Zimbabwe’s flagship Hwange National Park.
The camp is discreetly tucked away in a teak forest &amp; overlooks a waterhole that sees a regular procession of animals coming down to drink.
Hwange National Park offers superb year-round game viewing with frequent sightings of lion, elephant &amp; white rhino as well as a wide variety of antelope.  Excellent birding can also be expected as well as fantastic photographic opportunities.

#### Stay
Small &amp; intimate, Little Makalolo only has 5 stylish safari tents &amp; 1 family tent, each featuring an en-suite bathroom, indoor &amp; outdoor shower &amp; beautiful views over the bush.
The family tent consists of 2 en-suite bedrooms, each with a private entrance.  These bedrooms are connected via an inter-leading door.
The main lodge area includes a bar, library &amp; swimming pool.

#### Activities
At Little Makalolo, a variety of exciting safari activities are available.  Morning &amp; afternoon game drives in open 4x4 vehicles will allow guests to experience up-close-&amp;-personal wildlife encounters &amp; sleeping out under the stars is a bucket-list activity on everyone’s list!
Guests can also enjoy bird watching or take a refreshing dip in the lodge’s swimming pool.
Another favourite is sitting on the deck while watching animals come down to the waterhole to drink.
