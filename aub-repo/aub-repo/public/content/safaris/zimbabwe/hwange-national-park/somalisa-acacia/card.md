### Somalisa Acacia

#### Experience
Somalisa Acacia is a stylish, stilted tented safari camp that lies in Zimbabwe’s flagship Hwange National Park &amp; overlooks a busy waterhole.
The camp is built along the Kennedy vlei line, which means guests can expect plenty of wildlife action on game drives.
Hwange National Park offers superb year-round game viewing with frequent sightings of lion, elephant &amp; white rhino as well as a wide variety of antelope.  Excellent birding can also be expected as well as fantastic photographic opportunities.
Because the camp is so small &amp; intimate, it is the ideal safari choice for families or groups looking for an exclusive safari experience.

#### Stay
There are 6 spacious &amp; stylish tented suites at Somalisa Acacia.  Each tented suite is set on a raised deck around a central dining &amp; relaxation area that looks out over a busy waterhole.
Two of these tents are two-bedroom family units with inter-leading walkways between the parents &amp; children’s rooms which are both en-suite, as well as 2 additional stand-alone canvas tents.
Each tent includes a glass wood-burner fireplace for chilly winter evenings, an en-suite bathroom with indoor &amp; outdoor shower as well as a copper bathtub.
One of the highlights of staying at Somalisa Acacia is watching the elephants come to drink from the comfort of the lodge’s swimming pool.

#### Activities
Guests staying at Somalisa Acacia will be able to enjoy game drives, guided walking safaris, swimming or relaxing in a hammock on their private deck. 
The Ngwana Club will keep the young ones entertained &amp; expose them to the exciting world of the African bush.
