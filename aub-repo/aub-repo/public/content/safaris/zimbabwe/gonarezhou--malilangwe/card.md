## Zimbabwe
### Gonarezhou & Malilangwe

#### Experience
Hidden away in a quiet corner of Zimbabwe, lies one of the country’s biggest secrets: Gonarezhou National Park.
The park is wild & unexplored, offering visitors an authentic, off-the-beaten-track safari experience along with breathtaking scenery & diverse game viewing.
Gonarezhou is home to the coveted Big 5 – lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo & rhino – & many of the park’s rivers attract a wealth of wildlife, including antelope, zebra, giraffe, wild dog & cheetah. Bird lovers will be happy to know that the reserve is also home to 400 recorded species of bird.
But Gonarezhou’s trump card is a 130,000-hectare private reserve bordering the park: Malilangwe Wildlife Reserve, set to become one of Southern Africa’s most unique & exciting wildlife destinations.
Malilangwe offers thrilling Big 5 wildlife encounters & excellent birding against the picturesque backdrop of towering, red cliffs & massive baobab trees. What makes the reserve so special, is that a non-profit trust runs in conjunction with nearby communities, which means that Malilangwe both improves the lives of local Zimbabweans & contributes to the conservation of many rare & endangered animals.

#### Activities
There are a variety of safari activities to be enjoyed at Malilangwe Wildlife Reserve in Gonarezhou National Park.
Some of these include open 4x4 game viewing, stargazing safaris, fishing, biking & archery.

#### When to travel
The best time to visit Gonarezhou & Malilangwe is during Zimbabwe’s dry season, which is from May to October. Daily temperatures are mild between May & August while September & October can be extremely hot, though the wildlife viewing is spectacular.
The wet, rainy season is from November to March, peaking in January & February. Game viewing is more challenging during this time, but the reserve turns into a lush, green paradise & bird watching is at its best.
