#### Experience
The owner-run Batonka Lodge is set within easy walking distance to the majestic Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe.
This small &amp; elegant retreat offers good value &amp; comfortable inter-leading rooms, which makes this the first choice for families travelling with children.  
Seeing the majestic Victoria Falls is on everyone’s bucket list!  Not only can guests view the thundering waterfall from up-close, but they can also enjoy a variety of exciting activities in Africa’s adventure capital.

#### Stay
Batonka Lodge has 22 garden-view suites, each designed with privacy in mind.  Each air-conditioned suite includes an en-suite bathroom with an indoor shower.  Some of the rooms also have additional bathtubs.  
All suites have private verandas that open onto the surrounding lawns.  There are several inter-leading rooms that make Batonka ideal for families.  
The indoor living space at Batonka comprises a dining room, lounge, fireplace &amp; a stepped garden with a swimming pool.
The main outdoor area features a large veranda for enjoying cheerful breakfasts &amp; pre-dinner drinks.  There is also a bar area under a shady canopy as well as an outdoor lounge.

#### Activities
Zimbabwe is not called the adventure capital of Africa for nothing!  There is a wide range of activities available to travellers that can either be pre-booked through us or directly at the lodge.
Some of these include helicopter flights over the Falls, white water river rafting or canoeing on the mighty Zambezi River, swimming at Devil’s Pool, lunch at Livingstone island, sunset boat cruises, bungee jumping, elephant interactions &amp; much more!
