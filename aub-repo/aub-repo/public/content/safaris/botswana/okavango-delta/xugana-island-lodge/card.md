### Xugana Island Lodge

#### Experience
Xugana Island Lodge is situated on the edge of Xugana island in the heart of Botswana’s Okavango Delta. The lodge faces onto the blue waters &amp; tranquillity of Xugana Lagoon, which is widely accepted as the most spectacular permanent water site in the Delta.  
The lodge assures a year-round water experience under a canopy of wild ebony &amp; garcinia trees.

#### Stay
Xugana Island Lodge accommodates only 16 guests in 8 reed &amp; thatch lagoon-facing en-suite chalets, each with a private viewing deck.
Other facilities include an open-sided thatched lounge, bar &amp; dining area as well as a swimming pool, located within the mature gardens in the centre of the island.  After a day out, you can choose to unwind in the pool which is submerged in the reeds on the banks of the lagoon.  
Xugana Island Lodge’s boma &amp; alfresco dining area both overlook the Xugana Lagoon’s expanse of pristine water of this unique delta.

#### Activities
Guests can either explore the delta by motorboat or mokoro or take leisurely walks on the surrounding islands in the concession.
