# Delta Camp
## Okavango Delta
### Delta Camp

#### Experience
Delta Camp, like the name indicates, is situated on the southwestern edge of the palm-fringed Chief’s Island in the heart of the famous Okavango Delta.
The Okavango Delta has earned its reputation as one of the world’s premier wildlife areas, &amp; with its crystal-clear channels, lagoons, sweeping floodplains &amp; countless islands – is home to a variety of wildlife.  
The focus of the camp is on peace &amp; tranquillity, although many adventurous activities provide all the excitement one could wish for.

#### Stay
Delta Camp features only 7 luxury reed chalets with en-suite facilities – each raised on stilts.  Because the chalets are raised, guests can enjoy the wonderful views Botswana has to offer.
Three of these chalets are double units, ideal for couples.  There are also 2 triple units for parents travelling with 1 child as well as 2 family units that can sleep 2 adults &amp; 2 children. 
The chalets have been designed in such a way that guests can enjoy the luxuries of a ‘top rate’ hotel, but without affecting the environment.  Sleeping amongst the trees while taking full advantage of the bush is what Africa is all about.
The lodge has an elegant dining area with stunning views of the area &amp; the roaming wildlife.  If you are looking for a more secluded dining experience, you can have a prepared picnic on one of the nearby islands.

#### Activities
The camp offers exciting mokoro trips in dug-out canoes as well as guided nature walks &amp; even sleep-outs in the surrounding area should you stay for 4 nights or longer.
Guests can also visit one of the nearby traditional local villages to learn more about the Botswana culture.
