# Seba Camp
## Okavango Delta
### Seba Camp

#### Experience
Seba Camp is set in the Okavango Delta of Botswana &amp; overlooks a lagoon with prolific birdlife &amp; resident pods of hippo.  The camp is named after Seba, one of the elephants historically released from nearby Abu Camp.
As a baby, Seba starred in the Walt Disney movie, Whispers, which was filmed in the area.  The word “seba” means whisper in the local language.  Seba &amp; several other elephants that were released back into the wild have now formed their own heard near camp.

#### Stay
Seba Camp has 6 well-appointed tents raised from the ground, each with an en-suite bathroom &amp; private deck with breathtaking views of the lagoon &amp; passing wildlife.
Two other inter-leading tents serve as a family unit &amp; sleep a maximum of 4 guests.  The family tent has a private plunge pool, toys/game selection for children &amp; 2 bathrooms.
There is also an upstairs lounge with a pull-out sleeper couch for larger families.  Kids always enjoy the built-in ‘treehouse’ on the elevated deck with a dedicated swimming pool &amp; sandpit. 
The main area consists of a dining room, bar &amp; lounge-library, as well as a swimming pool for cooling off.
