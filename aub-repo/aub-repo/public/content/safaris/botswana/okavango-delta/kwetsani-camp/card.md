# Kwetsani Camp
## Okavango Delta
### Kwetsani Camp

#### Experience
Kwetsani Camp is situated on an elongated island within the central region of the Jao Concession in the gorgeous Okavango Delta.  
Just north of Jao Camp on the same floodplain system, Kwetsani Camp boasts spectacular views over the floodplains &amp; Okavango Delta vistas.
The camp is surrounded by beautiful islands &amp; riverine forests, making this one of the most beautiful sights in Botswana.

#### Stay
Kwetsani Camp has 5 distinctly designed ‘treehouses’, each with an en-suite bathroom.  The dining room, lounge &amp; bar area are constructed under a large thatch roof, offering incredible views of the game-packed surrounding floodplains.  
The camp also has a communal pool – the ideal place to relax after a day of tracking wildlife.

#### Activities
Depending on the water levels, Kwetsani Camp offers excellent land &amp; water activities, including open 4x4 game drives &amp; exciting mokoro safaris in dug-out canoes. 
During times of high water, Kwetsani guests can also visit Hunda Island for game drives, complete with a gourmet picnic for a full-day excursion.
Wildlife viewing can also be enjoyed from one of the 2 platform hides further out in the concession.  
Lion, leopard, wild dog &amp; cheetah are among the major game attractions at Kwetsani Camp, while the lagoons are filled with hippo &amp; crocodile.  Nocturnal animals can often be seen during night drives.
