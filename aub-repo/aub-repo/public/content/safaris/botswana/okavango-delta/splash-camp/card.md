# Splash Camp
## Okavango Delta
### Splash Camp

#### Experience
Splash Camp enjoys a beautiful location in the heart of the Okavango Delta, within the Kwara Private Reserve.  The camp is built around a natural waterhole, which attracts wildlife year-round.
Historically, this was the first place that those travelling from Maun to the Delta would hit significant water, so ‘Splash’ became a shorthand nickname for the area.
The Private Kwara Reserve shares an aquatic boundary with the famous Moremi Game Reserve, so land &amp; water-based activities can be enjoyed.

#### Stay
Splash Camp boasts 10 rooms that are situated around a natural waterhole.  Two of these include family rooms that are identical to the double rooms, except for an additional adjoining twin bedroom for the children. 
All rooms are en-suite &amp; offer indoor &amp; outdoor showers.  In addition, each room has a private veranda with lounge chairs, the perfect place to relax &amp; take in the magnificent views.
The open-air main area includes a bar, lounge, plunge pool &amp; curio shop.  The fire pit looks out over the waterhole, so here guests can enjoy a light breakfast before heading off on activities.

#### Activities
Because Splash Camp enjoys a permanent water location, it offers a variety of exciting land &amp; water-based activities.  These include open 4x4 game drives, mokoro safaris in dug-out canoes &amp; boating trips on the waterways of the Delta.
