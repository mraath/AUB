# Linyanti Tented Camp
## Linyanti Wildlife Reserve
### Linyanti Tented Camp

#### Experience
Linyanti Tented Camp is located on the iconic Linyanti Marsh, within easy access to a combination of habitats, floodplains, open-dry land savannah &amp; woodland, &amp; therefore attracts large numbers of big game &amp; birds.
The camp offers the perfect blend between adventure &amp; luxury, offering guests a thrilling &amp; intimate safari experience.  Families &amp; small groups love to include a stop here since this hugely diverse area not only provides excellent wildlife opportunities but ensures a comfortable night’s rest in luxury tents.

#### Stay
Linyanti Tented Camp consists of an East &amp; West wing.  Each wing boasts 4 spacious twin-bedded tents under canvas, each with two three quarter beds, en-suite bathrooms and shaded outdoor decks.
The camp’s main area is built on a slightly raised deck with impressive views, &amp; the ideal place from which to watch the passing parade of wildlife.  Evenings are spent around the crackling fire under the stars or in the traditional boma.

#### Activities
Since the camp is built in a private concession, guests are allowed to enjoy off-road driving as well as night drives, something that is not permitted in the National Parks.  Game drives are conducted in open 4x4 vehicles.  A big favourite is exploring the bush after dark in search of some of Africa’s shyer nocturnal animals.
For close encounters with Africa’s smaller animals &amp; plants, guests can also experience the bush on foot.  A photographic hide is available for those interested in capturing the perfect picture &amp; helicopter trips are also available at an additional cost.
