## The Savuti
### Camp Savuti

#### Experience
Located on the banks of the Savuti channel, bordering the Chobe National Park, Camp Savuti is an intimate safari lodge offering fantastic game viewing opportunities year-round.
The Savuti Marsh, fed by the Savuti Channel, has developed a reputation over the years as one of the world’s premier predator viewing areas, boasting one of the highest concentrations of wildlife on the African continent.

#### Stay
Camp Savuti boasts spectacular views over the Savuti Marsh &amp; accommodate a maximum of 10 guests in only 5 Meru-style tented rooms.  Each tent has an en-suite bathroom &amp; elevated balcony taking advantage of these magnificent views.
In the main area, you will find a communal dining area &amp; bar where guests can enjoy pre-dinner cocktails or enjoy watching the sun sets over the bush.

#### Activities
Open 4x4 game drives are offered in the morning &amp; evening, bringing guests closer to nature.  
The Savuti is famous for lion &amp; elephant interactions &amp; is – without a doubt – one of the best places in Africa to see both of these species.
