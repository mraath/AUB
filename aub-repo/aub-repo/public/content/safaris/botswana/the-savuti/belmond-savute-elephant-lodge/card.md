### Belmond Savute Elephant Lodge

#### Experience
Belmond Savute Elephant Lodge is located on the Savute Channel in the southern part of the Chobe National Park in Botswana.
As its name suggests, Savute Elephant Camp is best known for its resident herds of elephants that can be spotted roaming the plains.
Now that the Savute Channel is flowing again for the first time in nearly 30 years, other large animals also gather here to slake their thirst.

#### Stay
Belmond Savute Elephant Lodge consists of 12 luxury safari tents, each with an en-suite bathroom &amp; timber viewing deck.  The main area includes a lounge, dining area &amp; famous “Elephant proof” swimming pool where guests are often surprised by the playful resident herd.
A traditional boma welcomes guests to relax around a cosy campfire &amp; share safari experiences while dining under the beautiful African sky.

#### Activities
Open 4x4 morning &amp; afternoon game drives will take guests on a journey they will never forget.  The game-rich Chobe area never fails to impress its visitors as excellent year-round game viewing can be expected.
Stargazing opportunities are ample &amp; spa treatments are also on offer for guests looking to unwind.
