# The Savuti
## Botswana
### The Savuti

#### Experience
The Savuti (also spelt Savute) is a remote, wildlife-packed region of Chobe National Park.
Usually accessed by air, Savuti consists of open woodlands that provide a habitat for large antelope &amp buffalo herds, preyed on by big cats &amp wild dogs, while the reserve’s permanent waterholes ensure that elephants remain in Savuti all year.
What makes the Savute so rewarding are the clear waters of the Savute Channel, now flowing for the first time in 30 years. Its banks are teeming with wildlife &amp birds – so wildlife viewing is excellent throughout the year.

#### Activities
The focus at Savuti is on open 4x4 game drives – the best way to get close-up encounters with Africa’s wildlife. Guests can experience both morning &amp afternoon game drives led by expert local guides.
This game-rich area of the Chobe National Park offers excellent predator sightings, including big lion prides as well as leopard, cheetah &amp hyena.

#### When to travel
The best time to visit the Savuti region is from July to October, during the dry winter season when temperatures are moderate &amp wildlife viewing is exceptional.
During the shoulder season, April to May &amp November, game viewing is also good &amp rates are lower than in high season.
The wet, green season is from December to March. Bird watching is at its best &amp rates are extremely competitive.
