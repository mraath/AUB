#### Experience
Jack’s Camp, an authentic &amp; luxurious camp is set in a private concession on the border of the Makgadikgadi Pans of Botswana.
Surrounded by desert &amp; salt pans, Jack’s Camp provides a unique safari experience that cannot be found anywhere else in the country.  It is the only camp in Africa with a swimming pool tent, &amp; one of a few that offers exciting Meerkat encounters.

#### Stay
Accommodation is in 10 beautiful canvas tents, decorated in a classic 1940’s safari style.  Each tent is equipped with an en-suite bathroom boasting an indoor &amp; outdoor shower.  The tent decks offer spectacular views over the desert, along with gorgeous sunrises &amp; sunsets.
The central guest area consists of a comfortable lounge &amp; bar area overlooking the salt pans as well as a cosy fireplace &amp; sparkling swimming pool.

#### Activities
A blockbuster of activities are offered from Jack’s Camp, including open 4x4 safari drives in the Makgadikgadi National Park as well as thrilling night drives &amp; walks with Bushmen guides. A real highlight is spending time with the resident meerkats, something unique to this area.  
Quad bike trips to the Ntwetwe Pan is a great way to explore the area &amp; guests can also visit Chapman’s Boabab – a true historic gem of Botswana.  Guests can also explore the desert on horseback while watching the sunset.
