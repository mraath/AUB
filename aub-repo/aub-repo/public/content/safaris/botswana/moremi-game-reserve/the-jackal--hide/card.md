# The Jackal & Hide
## Moremi Game Reserve
### The Jackal & Hide

#### Experience
The Jackal &amp; Hide is Sable Alley Camp’s little sister &amp; boasts an amazing location within the Khwai Private Concession in the Moremi Game Reserve.
The best way to experience a Botswana luxury safari is in a private concession where off-road game drives &amp; night drives are permitted.  The Jackal &amp; Hide, therefore, offers close encounters with some of Africa’s most prolific wildlife.

#### Stay
This small &amp; intimate camp offers only 8 Meru-style tents, each equipped with an en-suite bathroom &amp; private veranda with beautiful views across the shimmering grasslands.
The Jackal &amp; Hide’s main area comprises a comfortable lounge, bar &amp; dining area as well as a sunken lounge &amp; fire pit, the ideal spot to enjoy that first morning cup of coffee or early afternoon G&amp;T.  
Located just in front of a favourite grazing spot for zebra &amp; elephant, it is a fabulous wildlife-watching base during siesta time too.

#### Activities
Safari activities at The Jackal &amp; Hide include morning, afternoon &amp; evening game drives in open 4x4 vehicles, dug-out mokoro canoe safaris (water levels permitting) as well taking amazing photos from one of the ground-level hides.
Spending a night sleeping under the stars in one of the Sky Bed Platforms will certainly be a night to remember. (between April &amp; October)
