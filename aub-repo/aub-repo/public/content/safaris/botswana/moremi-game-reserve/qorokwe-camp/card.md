## Moremi Game Reserve
### Qorokwe Camp

#### Experience
Fittingly, the name Qorokwe means “the place where the buffalo broke through the bush into the water,” evoking the high-density game area in which this camp is situated. 
Due to the mix of habitats that lie between its western &amp; eastern borders, this region is a magnet for wildlife.
Qorokwe Camp is a blend of eco-chic within a beautiful Okavango Delta setting &amp; attracts good concentrations of larger predators – lion, leopard, spotted hyena, cheetah &amp; wild dog.  Elephant herds are also frequently spotted here.

#### Stay
The camp combines a contemporary style with a classic bush feel.  It has 8 tented suites as well as 1 spacious family unit with a private plunge pool.  All tents have en-suite bathrooms.
The entire camp, including the spacious main area, enjoy wonderful views over the lagoon.  There is also an infinity pool where guests can put up their feet or relax after a day out in the bush.

#### Activities
The perfect Botswana luxury safari includes both land &amp; water-based activities.  
At Qorokwe Camp guests can enjoy all that Botswana has to offer.  Activities include open 4x4 game drives, night drives, mokoro safaris in dug-out canoes, boating on the waterways of the Delta as well as walking safaris with a qualified guide.
