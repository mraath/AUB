# Khwai Leadwood Camp
## Moremi Game Reserve
### Khwai Leadwood Camp

#### Experience
Khwai Leadwood Camp is set in a private community-run concession on the eastern border of the world-renowned Moremi Game Reserve.
The Khwai River runs through the concession &amp; forms a boundary between the reserve &amp; the community area, allowing for excellent wildlife viewing year-round.  Since the area is generally quite dry, the Khwai River is often the only water source for thirsty animals, allowing for a game-packed safari experience.

#### Stay
Khwai Leadwood Camp consists of 6 spacious Meru-style tents, complete with comfortable beds &amp; en-suite bathrooms.  There is also a family unit for parents travelling with children.
In the main area, you will find a comfortable lounge, dining room, bar &amp; pool where guests can put up their feet &amp; relax after a day out in the bush.

#### Activities
Since the camp is built in a community area, guests are allowed off-road driving as well as night drives, something that is not permitted in the National Parks.  Game drives are conducted in open 4x4 vehicles.  A big favourite is exploring the bush after dark in search of some of Africa’s shyer nocturnal animals.
Exploring the waterways of the Delta in a mokoro (dug-out canoe) is quite an experience.  
For close encounters with Africa’s smaller animals &amp; plants, guests can also experience the bush on foot.  Local village visits are also available for guests who wish to learn more about the Botswana culture.
The Kids Club offers the little ones nature walks around camp, arts &amp; crafts, cooking lessons &amp; many more exciting activities.
