### Great Plains Expeditions - Botswana

#### Experience
Have you ever dreamed of an authentic, off-the-beaten-track wilderness experience?  
The Great Plains Expeditions offers a 4-night (set departure) Botswana cross country safari through the private Selinda Reserve in either an easterly or westerly direction.
Adventurous safari-goers will witness Selinda’s best wildlife sightings, including leopard, pangolin &amp; wild dog. 
On this cross country safari, exhilarating activities will take guests through an area that is home to the highest density of elephants globally &amp; in the spirit of genuine expedition, guests can even get involved in collecting data that will assist with anti-poaching.  
Here, in one of Botswana’s most remote regions, guests can also encounter some of Africa’s most incredible elephant &amp; buffalo interactions.

#### Stay
On each 4-night departure, the Great Plains Expeditions offers 3 beautiful camps set within the heart of the Selinda Reserve.  One night is spent at the first &amp; last camp, &amp; 2 nights are spent at the second camp where excellent walking &amp; canoeing can be enjoyed.
Small &amp; intimate, a Great Plains Expeditions safari can accommodate a maximum of 8 guests sharing 4 tents, each with 2 single beds.  Children of 12 years &amp; older are welcome to join this once-in-a-lifetime safari experience through Botswana.

#### Activities
A range of exciting wildlife viewing activities is included in your stay.  
Open 4x4 game drives will take you straight into the action while guided walking safaris &amp; canoeing along the Selinda Spillway (water levels permitting) offer a different perspective.
Frequent sightings of cheetah can be expected as well as some of the best, &amp; possibly even final, large concentrations of sable &amp; roan antelope.
