### Phinda Mountain Lodge

#### Experience
Phinda Mountain Lodge lies in the gorgeous Zululand bushveld, in Kwazulu Natal’s Phinda Resource Reserve.  Home to the Big 5, Phinda provides phenomenal game viewing year-round.
With wrap-around views of the magnificent Lebombo mountain range, Phinda Game Reserve is a dramatic safari destination of note.  The reserve has a huge diversity of landscapes – with lake, mountain &amp; coastal plain views from the lodge.

#### Stay
Accommodation comprises 20 suites (of which 4 are family suites) as well as 9 cottages (of which 3 are family cottages).
The spacious-split-level suites each features a lounge &amp; en-suite bathroom, opening onto a private deck &amp; plunge pool overlooking the bushveld.  Paved pathways lead down the mountainside from the main lodge to the chalets.
The cottages, slightly smaller than the suites, each feature a private sitting area, veranda with plunge pool &amp; outdoor shower.  
The family suites &amp; family cottages consist of 2 bedrooms, so are ideal for parents travelling with children.
The main lodge features a comfortable lounge, dining area, shaded terrace, sunset bar &amp; viewing deck.  There is also a gym, swimming pool &amp; open-air boma where dinners can be enjoyed under the stars.

#### Activities
Phinda enjoys excellent game viewing.  
Guests can journey through the African bush on open 4x4 game drives or explore the reserve on foot.  Other exhilarating activities include rhino tracking, bird watching, river cruises &amp; canoe safaris as well as local community visits.
