# Kariega Game Reserve
## Eastern Cape
### Kariega Game Reserve

#### Experience
Situated on South Africa’s malaria-free Garden Route, Kariega Game Reserve spans across 10,000 hectares of pristine Eastern Cape wilderness &amp; is home to the Kariega &amp; Bushman’s Rivers that not only attracts an abundance of wildlife but allow guests to experience both land &amp; water-based safari activities.
The reserve is home to the famous Big 5 – lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo &amp; rhino as well as a multitude of African wildlife, including hippo, giraffe &amp; zebra.  Bird watching is also spectacular.
With its accessible location, breathtaking scenery and Big 5 game viewing, Kariega Game Reserve is the perfect safari add-on to a trip along South Africa’s world-famous Garden Route or even as a fly-in destination from Cape Town.

#### Activities
Since the Kariega &amp; Bushman’s Rivers cut through the reserve, Kariega offers a variety of exciting land &amp; water-based safari activities.
Land-based activities include open 4x4 game drives in search of big game as well as expert-led walking safaris.  Other fun-filled river-based activities include sunset boat cruises, kayaking, fishing &amp; even beach trips by boat.

#### When to travel
Traditionally the most popular time to visit Kariega Game Reserve is from late August to early May, but the winter months offer an equally spectacular safari experience - but be sure to pack a good winter jacket if you are travelling between June &amp; August.
Each of the summer and winter safari experiences in the Eastern Cape has something unique &amp; special to offer.  In winter, the animals move to open water sources, the vegetation is sparser &amp; temperatures lower, all of which contribute to excellent game viewing.
In summer, there are loads of newborns animals &amp; the migratory birds arrive which makes for excellent bird watching.
