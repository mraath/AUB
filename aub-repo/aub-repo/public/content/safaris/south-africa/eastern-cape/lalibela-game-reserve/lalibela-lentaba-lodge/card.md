#### Experience
Lalibela Game Reserve in the Eastern Cape consists of 7,500 hectares of land &amp; is home to Africa’s Big 5 – lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo &amp; rhino.  
Only an hour away from Port Elizabeth &amp; Addo Elephant Park, Lalibela is the perfect safari getaway for guests visiting the Garden Route on a self-drive holiday.

#### Stay
Lalibela Lentaba Lodge boasts a spectacular location on a hillside &amp; sleeps only 20 people in 10 secluded thatched chalets. (5 luxury &amp; 5 classic)  The chalets are set among a beautiful landscape, where indigenous gardens merge into the surrounding bush.
Each traditional-styled en-suite chalet has a private observation deck with bush views as well as air-conditioning for those really hot summer days.
The main lodge includes a large lounge, viewing deck, sunny swimming pool, outdoor boma with waterhole view &amp; stylish indoor dining area.

#### Activities
Guests visiting Lalibela can expect to see a variety of game during their time on safari.  Twice daily game drives in open 4x4 vehicles will ensure excellent photographic opportunities &amp; close wildlife encounters.
