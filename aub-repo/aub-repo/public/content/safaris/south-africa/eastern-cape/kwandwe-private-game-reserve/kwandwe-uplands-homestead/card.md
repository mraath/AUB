## Kwandwe Private Game Reserve
### Kwandwe Uplands Homestead

#### Experience
The world-class Kwandwe Private Game Reserve is nestled in the heart of South Africa’s unspoilt Eastern Cape Province in a malaria-free private wilderness &amp; is home to Kwandwe Uplands Homestead.
The 22,000-hectare reserve flanks both the north &amp; south banks of the Great Fish River, attracting a variety of game, including the Big 5.
Kwandwe is the closest game reserve to the vibrant &amp; cultural Grahamstown &amp; forms part of the Garden Route, making this an ideal stopover for travellers looking for a bush &amp; beach holiday.

#### Stay
Kwandwe Uplands Homestead is a private retreat, nestled within manicured gardens &amp; features only 3 suites with private verandas &amp; en-suite bathrooms.
Antique mirrors, yellowwood chests &amp; opulent wardrobes blend seamlessly with air-conditioning underfloor heating &amp; modern conveniences.  
The homestead’s kitchen is the heart &amp; soul of the villa.  Here meals are created to be shared by friends &amp; family under the African sky in the boma.
There is also a swimming pool where guests can relax after a day out in the African bush.

#### Activities
Open 4x4 game drives at Kwandwe never disappoint.  Apart from the Big 5, the reserve is also home to a wealth of other unique &amp; interesting animals.  
Guests can also enjoy walking safaris, scenic flights over the bush &amp; bird watching.
Because Kwandwe is a private reserve, night drives are permitted &amp; guests will have the opportunity to search for animals with a spotlight.
