### Eastern Cape

#### Experience
Just a short drive from the famed beaches &amp charming seaside towns of the Garden Route, South Africa's Eastern Cape Province emerges as a realm teeming with wildlife, offering warm hospitality, &amp brimming with exhilarating activities.
A defining feature of the Eastern Cape is its collection of game reserves, many of which are home to the legendary Big 5: lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo, &amp rhino. What sets this region apart is its status as a malaria-free haven, making it an excellent choice for families seeking child-friendly activities to keep the young ones engaged.
Among the most sought-after private reserves in the Eastern Cape, you'll find:
Addo Elephant National Park: This park is most renowned for its extensive herds of elephants, truly a sight to behold.
Shamwari: Noted for its remarkable conservation initiatives, Shamwari is committed to protecting &amp preserving the region's wildlife &amp natural beauty.
Kwandwe: Featuring four award-winning lodges, Kwandwe offers an unforgettable safari experience amid pristine wilderness.

#### Activities
The Eastern Cape offers a diverse range of activities for travelers to enjoy. While on safari, guests can embark on open 4x4 game drives in pursuit of iconic wildlife. Expert-led walking safaris provide an intimate look at the flora &amp fauna of the region, while tranquil river cruises &amp thrilling horseback expeditions offer unique ways to explore this captivating landscape.
For families, many lodges in the Eastern Cape have established Kids Clubs, which organize exciting activities such as scavenger hunts, arts &amp crafts sessions, educational games, movie nights, &amp even do-it-yourself pizza evenings.

#### When to travel
Wildlife viewing in the Eastern Cape is rewarding throughout the year. Thanks to the semi-arid climate of the region, animals are naturally drawn to water sources year-round. However, wildlife activity tends to be marginally more pronounced during the driest months, which span from June through September.
During these months, the nights can become quite chilly, so it's advisable to pack warm clothing for game drives conducted in open vehicles.
