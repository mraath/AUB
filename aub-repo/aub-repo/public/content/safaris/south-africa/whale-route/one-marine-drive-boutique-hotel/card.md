#### Experience
One Marine Drive Boutique Hotel is situated on the oceanfront of Hermanus – a quaint coastal town that offers the best land-based whale watching in the world.
Small &amp; intimate, this boutique hotel offers only 5 suites with sensational views over the ocean -the perfect place from which to witness frolicking whales between July &amp; November each year.
Within walking distance, you will find the seaside town’s exciting shops, art galleries, restaurants, bars &amp; markets, as well as the famous Cliff Path – the very place where whales are spotted each day in season.
Nearby, guests can enjoy wine tasting at one of 14 estates or play a round of golf at the 27-hole course with only the mountain as a backdrop.

#### Stay
One Marine Drive Boutique Hotel features 8 individually decorated suites with en-suite bathrooms.
There are sea view rooms, garden view rooms &amp; pool view suites – all with balconies or terraces looking out over either the ocean, garden or pool.
The boutique hotel features a heated swimming pool in a secluded courtyard garden as well as a cosy living &amp; dining area with a log burning fireplace for chilly, winter evenings.

#### Activities

There is a walking path right in front of the villa, so you can walk for miles on end while enjoying some of the best land-based whale watching in the world.   Guests can also go mountain biking, hiking or bird watching &amp; even play a round of golf at the nearby 27-hole course.
