### South Africa

#### Experience
South Africa has it all! Also known as the ‘Rainbow Nation,’ this beautiful country is one of amazing diversity. Not only is it a metaphor for the coming together of all different people who live in South Africa – a nation with 11 official languages – but this perfectly descriptive name also points to the country’s incredible biodiversity.
Home to game-packed wildlife reserves, lush vineyards, spectacular mountains & pristine beaches, South Africa gives a feeling of entering a completely different world constantly, all within one country. This means that the best time of the year to visit South Africa is whenever you’ve got time off work!
Here, you’ll find world-class cuisine, exceptional service & spectacular scenery. Due to South Africa’s great infrastructure, it is easy to get around – be that via flight, private transfer or self-drive. 
One of South Africa’s biggest drawcards is the Kruger’s private reserves where you can witness Africa’s most reliable Big 5 game viewing, while Cape Town & its surrounding Wine Route offer an elegant & sophisticated twist to a South African holiday.
Between July & November, you can witness the best land-based whale watching in the world along the Whale Route while the scenic Garden Route is ideal for family holidays & self-drive adventures – especially when combined with the malaria-free wildlife reserves of the Eastern Cape. KwaZulu-Natal’s big game parks, rugged mountain ranges & pristine beaches are great add-ons to a South African holiday.

#### Stay
South Africa offers an impressive variety of safari lodges, boutique hotels, private villas, self-catering apartments & large hotels – something for every type of traveller.

#### When to travel
The country is large & diverse with a climate that varies from region to region. If it’s Summer you’re after, the best time to visit South Africa is generally from December to March. For those who enjoy a chilly climate, a good time to visit South Africa is when winter kicks in from July to August. Cape Town & the Western Cape experience a winter rainfall & a largely dry, hot summer while most of the rest of the country, including the Kruger, have summer thundershowers & a dry winter.
The Garden Route & Eastern Cape can experience rain at any time of year. The best time for a safari in South Africa is between May & October while Cape Town’s weather is best between November to March. Whale watching season is from July to November while the Wine Route & Garden Route can be visited any time of the year.
