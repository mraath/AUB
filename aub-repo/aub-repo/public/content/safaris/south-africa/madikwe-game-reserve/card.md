## South Africa
### Madikwe Game Reserve

#### Experience
Madikwe Private Game Reserve, sprawling across 75,000 hectares, stands as one of South Africa's most expansive Big 5 reserves. Nestled on the fringes of the Kalahari &amp bordering Botswana, Madikwe is renowned for its remarkable wildlife encounters, boasting the coveted Big 5 – lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo, &amp rhino – as well as a rich array of other wildlife.
For wildlife enthusiasts, Madikwe is nothing short of a paradise. It's undeniably one of the finest locations in the country to witness the rare &amp endangered African wild dog, a captivating sight that draws safari enthusiasts from across the globe.
What sets Madikwe apart is its private ownership &amp management, which means day visitors are not permitted. This exclusivity ensures an intimate &amp private safari experience, as it should be. The reserve allows off-road driving &amp night drives, providing guests with extraordinary opportunities for up-close wildlife encounters &amp exceptional photographic moments.
Furthermore, Madikwe boasts a malaria-free status, making it an ideal choice for families with young children. The reserve offers an extensive selection of family-friendly safari lodges that provide exciting children's activities, dedicated meals, &amp even babysitting services.
Couples &amp honeymooners are not overlooked either. Madikwe is home to luxurious lodges, some of which offer private plunge pools &amp the chance to savor romantic al fresco dinners amidst the untamed wilderness.

#### Activities
Visitors to Madikwe Game Reserve have the privilege of observing Africa's magnificent creatures in their natural habitat. This is made possible through twice-daily open 4x4 game drives &amp immersive nature walks led by expert guides.
Game drives are conducted both in the morning &amp afternoon, with evening sessions allowing guests to search for nocturnal animals with the aid of a spotlight. Off-road driving adds a thrilling dimension to safaris, ensuring wildlife encounters of the highest quality.

#### When to travel
The dry season, spanning from May to September, is the prime period for wildlife viewing throughout the region. During this time, the vegetation thins out, making it easier to spot wildlife. The months of April and October are considered shoulder seasons &amp also offer excellent game viewing opportunities.
In contrast, the rainy season from December to March transforms Madikwe into a lush &amp vibrant paradise. This period showcases sensational birding opportunities &amp brings forth a wave of baby animals, a favored prey for the many predators that roam Madikwe.
