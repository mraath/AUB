### Honeyguide Khoka Moya Camp

#### Experience
Honeyguide Tented Camps are located within the beautiful Manyeleti Reserve in the Greater Kruger.  
Honeyguide includes 2 tented camps – Khoka Moya &amp; Mantobeni.  Khoka Moya is a family-friendly camp &amp; Mantobeni is ideal for couples or adults looking for peace &amp; tranquillity.  
At Honeyguide Khoka Moya, guests will experience an authentic safari – without compromising on luxury, comfort &amp; style.  Children of all ages are welcome, making this one of the best family-friendly camps in the country.

#### Stay
Khoka Moya is situated on both sides of a riverbed &amp; comprises 15 spacious tents, each with an en-suite bathroom &amp; a private outdoor seating area.  
The tents are contemporary in style &amp; are set in the heart of the bush where animals often wander past.  Each tent is large enough to accommodate 2 adults on a king-sized bed as well as 2 children on a pull-out comfortable sofa bed.  Babysitting can be arranged.
The main area consists of a lounge &amp; dining area as well as a cosy, open-air boma area where lazy nights are often spent around the crackling fire.

#### Activities
Morning &amp; afternoon game drives are conducted in open 4x4 safari vehicles.  After sundowners in the bush, guides will use a spotlight to search for nocturnal animals.  For the more adventurous, the bush can also be experienced on foot.  
The camp also features a children’s centre stocked with a DVD player, toys &amp; books as well as a bathing &amp; nappy changing facility &amp; a child-friendly swimming pool.
