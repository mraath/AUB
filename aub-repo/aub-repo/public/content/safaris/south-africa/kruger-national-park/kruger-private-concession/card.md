# Kruger Private Concession
## Kruger National Park
### Kruger Private Concession

#### Experience
The Kruger Concession is a privately-owned &amp; run reserve located within the Kruger National Park itself &amp; offers exceptional Big 5 wildlife viewing, along with luxurious lodges &amp; expert guiding.
Within these exclusive-use areas of the park, game viewing tends to be spectacular &amp; staying in one means that game drives may venture into the Kruger National Park, therefore experiencing the best of both worlds.
Home to some of the biggest name brands in the safari industry, such as Singita &amp; Lion Sands, the Kruger Concession never fails to impress when it comes to exceptional game viewing &amp; luxurious safari living.
Unlike the National Park, off-road driving &amp; night drives are permitted in the Kruger Concession, so here, safari enthusiasts can expect fantastic, close-up wildlife encounters.

#### Activities
Visitors get the opportunity to observe Africa’s magnificent creatures in the wild with twice-daily open 4x4 game drives &amp; nature walks with expert-led guides.  
Game drives take place twice daily - once in the morning &amp; once in the afternoon &amp; evening so that guests have an opportunity to search for nocturnal animals with a spotlight.
Off-road driving will take you straight into the action &amp; ensure wildlife encounters of the highest standard.

#### When to travel
Winter (May to September, also known as the dry season) is the best time for wildlife viewing throughout the region.  Vegetation thins during this time, so wildlife spotting is easy.
April &amp; October are considered shoulder months &amp; are also good for game viewing.  During the rainy season, December to March – the bush is lush &amp; it turns into a birder’s paradise.
