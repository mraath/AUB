### Lion Sands Narina Lodge

#### Experience
Lion Sands Narina Lodge enjoys a spectacular setting in the Kruger National Park’s Tinga Concession &amp; overlooks the Sabie River.  
The 5,000 hectares private concession invites a variety of wildlife &amp; exciting safari activities.  Guests can explore off-road driving, night drives, follow in the footsteps of a leopard, track down a herd of elephants, or simply wait for them to come to you.

#### Stay
Lion Sands Narina Lodge includes 9 luxury stilted suites perched among 100-year old trees overlooking the Sabie River.   
Each air-conditioned suite features an en-suite bathroom with an indoor &amp; outdoor shower as well as a private plunge pool where lazy afternoons can be spent relaxing in the sun.  The suites are designed with privacy in mind, so guests can watch the animals come down to the river from their pool, viewing deck, as well as bed &amp; bath!
The suites are linked to the central lodge area via elevated wooden walkways.
The main area features a large wooden river deck, cosy lounge &amp; bar area, swimming pool &amp; an outdoor boma where guests can enjoy al fresco dinners &amp; barbeques.

#### Activities
Plenty of activities are available at Lion Sands Narina Lodge.  The most popular is their open 4x4 game drives &amp; bush walks.  Guest can get close encounters with some of Africa’s wildest animals.
A highlight for most is spending a night in Tinyeleti Treehouse, a romantic treehouse set up in a remote corner of the bush, not too far from camp.  Guests can enjoy a private dinner in their treehouse before falling asleep under the stars.
Other exciting activities include spa treatments &amp; community initiatives.
