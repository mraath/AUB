# Pafuri Luxury Tented Camp
## Kruger Private Concession
### Pafuri Luxury Tented Camp

#### Experience
Pafuri Luxury Tented Camp enjoys a unique &amp; remote setting in the far north of the Kruger National Park.  
The concession lies in a vast triangle between the Limpopo &amp; Luvuhu Rivers along South Africa’s northeastern frontier.  Between them, the two great valleys embrace one of Africa’s most spectacular landscapes with mountains and gorges in the west giving way to plains, pans, baobabs and fever tree forests in the east.
This land harbours an abundance of life – huge herds of elephant, buffalo &amp; other game concentrate here, especially when the bush is eagerly awaiting the summer rains.  
Predators &amp; scavengers, ranging from cats &amp; hyenas to servals, genets, civets &amp; caracals, find shelter here.  This diverse area is also regarded as South Africa’s most rewarding birding destination.

#### Stay
Pafuri Luxury Tented Camp boasts 12 double tents &amp; 7 family tents, all with sweeping views over the Luvuhu River.  
All tents are raised on platforms &amp; connected via elevated walkways so that wildlife can move undisturbed to &amp; from the river.  Each tent has an en-suite bathroom with an indoor &amp; outdoor shower.
The family tents can each accommodate 2 adults &amp; 2 children.
Pafuri’s communal area includes an outdoor dining area, bush bar &amp; swimming pool.

#### Activities
A variety of activities are available at Pafuri Luxury Tented Camp.  
They include open 4x4 game drives, walking safaris with a qualified field guide, community tours to the Makuleke village, visits to a local school &amp; a reenactment of the history of the Makuleke people through theatre as well as a traditional lunch.
