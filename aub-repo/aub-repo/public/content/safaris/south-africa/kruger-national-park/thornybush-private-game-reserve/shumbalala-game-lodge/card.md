## Thornybush Private Game Reserve
### Shumbalala Game Lodge

#### Experience
Deep in the heart of the African bushveld, lies Shumbalala Lodge – a luxurious safari camp set in a quiet corner of the Thornybush Game Reserve in South Africa.
Everything at Shumbalala is out of this world.  From the personalized service, romantic atmosphere, spacious suites &amp; spectacular wildlife viewing, Shumbalala never fails to impress.

#### Stay
The lodge wants to remain small &amp; intimate &amp; therefore only allows 8 guests to stay at one time.  The luxurious suites are each equipped with an open fireplace, outside shower &amp; private viewing deck.
For families, the Presidential Suite offers a plunge pool, large deck &amp; private boma area where dinners can be enjoyed around the campfire.
Modern décor &amp; style are consistent throughout the lodge.  The main area features a lounge, dining room &amp; sparkling swimming pool overlooking the bush.

#### Activities
Guests can enjoy close encounters with Africa’s Big 5 in open 4x4 safari vehicles.  Exploring the bush on foot is another option for those wishing to get closer to nature.  
Guests can also enjoy relaxing treatments at the Mobile Amani Spa or book a scenic hot air balloon flight over the Blyde River at an additional cost.  Community village visits can also be arranged.
Dinners around the fire in the open-air boma are always a highlight.  It is here where stories are shared, tales are told &amp; friendships are formed.
