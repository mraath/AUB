# Waterbuck Lodge
## Thornybush Private Game Reserve
### Waterbuck Lodge

#### Experience
Situated on a dammed estuary in a high-water table area – Waterbuck Lodge has the ideal location in the heart of the Thornybush Game Reserve in South Africa.
This is the ideal destination to experience the abundance of life that water attracts – including the largest elephant herd in the reserve.
Since the lodge &amp; small &amp; intimate (&amp; can be booked on an exclusive use basis), Waterbuck Lodge is a wonderful choice for families or friends looking for a private or exclusive safari experience.

#### Stay
Each of the 4 air-conditioned suites has been built with absolute privacy in mind &amp; offers beautiful views across the African terrain.  Each suite has been individually decorated &amp; features a generous en-suite bathroom.
The main lodge area includes a large thatched open-plan dining &amp; lounge area as well as a breakfast deck with a bar &amp; a large family-sized pool overlooking the estuary.

#### Activities
Morning &amp; afternoon game drives are conducted in open 4x4 vehicles &amp; led by experienced rangers &amp; trackers who share a passion for the bush &amp; the environment.  
Exciting walking safaris are ideal for those looking to learn more about animal tracking or local fauna &amp; flora.
Guests can also book a scenic hot air balloon ride over the Blyde River at an additional cost, or visit one of the nearby local communities.
