# Monwana Lodge
## Thornybush Private Game Reserve
### Monwana Lodge

#### Experience
Situated in a quiet corner in the renowned Thornybush Game Reserve, Monwana Lodge offers wildlife encounters that will take your breath away.
This area is home to a variety of animals, including the Big 5 – lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo &amp; rhino – as well other game like zebra, impala, giraffe, cheetah &amp; many bird species.
The lodge overlooks a game-packed waterhole - one of the biggest drawcards in the area - so exciting game viewing opportunities can be enjoyed from the comfort of the viewing deck.

#### Stay
Small &amp; intimate, Monwana Lodge only has 3 standard suites (2 of these are inter-leading), 1 honeymoon suite &amp; 1 two-bedroom family suite.
All suites are equipped with an en-suite bathroom &amp; patio.  The honeymoon suite is slightly larger than the standard suites &amp; is ideally situated with privacy in mind.  The family suite is ideal for families travelling with young children.  The 2 bedrooms are separated by a passageway &amp; the suite offers a lovely wrap-around deck for ideal game viewing.
Four of the five suites boast magnificent views over an active waterhole.
The main lodge boasts a lounge, dining room, open-air boma &amp; large viewing deck which extends onto the Monwana River.  The gazebo with comfortable chairs overlooking the waterhole is the perfect place to kick off your shoes &amp; relax while watching animals quench their thirst.

#### Activities
Daily activities include a morning &amp; afternoon game drive as well as guided bush walks.  
After a sundowner stop in the bush, the night drive includes looking for nocturnal animals with a spotlight.  Perhaps you will see jackal, cheetah, spring hare &amp; the forever jumping bush baby?
Guests can also enjoy relaxing treatments from the Mobile Amani Spa or book a scenic hot air balloon flight over the Blyde River at an additional cost.  Community village visits can also be arranged.
