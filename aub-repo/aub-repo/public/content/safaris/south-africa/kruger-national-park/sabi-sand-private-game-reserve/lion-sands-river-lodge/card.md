### Lion Sands River Lodge

#### Experience
Lion Sands River Lodge is the heart &amp; soul of Lion Sands &amp; is built on the banks of the Sabie River in the Southern section of the Sabi Sand Reserve, adjacent to the Kruger National Park.
This area is well known for its spectacular game viewing.  In fact, guests don’t have to leave the lodge for excellent sightings – it is not uncommon to spot animals wandering by while relaxing in a lounger by the swimming pool.

#### Stay
Lion Sands River Lodge features 8 luxury rooms, 6 superior luxury suites, 3 river suites &amp; 1 family river suite.
Each of the 8 luxury rooms has an en-suite bathroom, lounge &amp; wooden deck with bush views.
The 6 superior luxury rooms are larger &amp; have ample open-plan bathrooms &amp; outdoor showers – 2 sets are inter-leading, making them ideal for families.
Each of the 3 river suites is located further away from the main lodge &amp; enjoy a more private setting.  The river views from these suites are fantastic &amp; best appreciated from the expansive decks.  The river suites also have romantic outdoor showers.
The family river suite has 2 bedrooms with inter-leading doors &amp; therefore an ideal choice for families travelling with young children.
The main lodge area features a spa, bar, large deck with pool, gym, library &amp; computer facilities.

#### Activities
