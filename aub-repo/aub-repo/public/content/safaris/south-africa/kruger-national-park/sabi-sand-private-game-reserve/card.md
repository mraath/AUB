### Sabi Sand Private Game Reserve

#### Experience
It is no surprise that the Sabi Sand Private Game Reserve is South Africa’s best wildlife destination &amp; few African reserves can compare to its exceptional Big 5 wildlife viewing, fantastic predator sightings &amp; big game encounters.
The 66,000-hectare Sabi Sand Reserve shares an unfenced, south-western boundary with the Kruger National Park &amp; is renowned for pioneering the luxury safari concept, with leading brands such as Singita, Mala Mala, Londolozi &amp; Sabi Sabi.
The reserve’s privately-owned lodges are tucked away in prime, game-rich locations &amp; enjoy exclusive traversing rights for intimate game viewing – away from crowds!
Game viewing here is truly exceptional, so don’t be surprised if you spot the Big 5 in a single game drive!

Unlike the National Park, off-road driving &amp; night drives are permitted in the Sabi Sand, so here, safari enthusiasts can expect fantastic, close-up wildlife encounters.

#### Activities
Visitors get the opportunity to observe Africa’s magnificent creatures in the wild with twice-daily open 4x4 game drives &amp; nature walks with expert-led guides.  
Game drives take place twice daily - once in the morning &amp; once in the afternoon &amp; evening so that guests have an opportunity to search for nocturnal animals with a spotlight.
Off-road driving will take you straight into the action &amp; ensure wildlife encounters of the highest standard.

#### When to travel
Winter (May to September, also known as the dry season) is the best time for wildlife viewing throughout the region.  Vegetation thins during this time, so wildlife spotting is easy.
April &amp; October are considered shoulder months &amp; are also good for game viewing.  During the rainy season, December to March – the bush is lush &amp; it turns into a birder’s paradise.
