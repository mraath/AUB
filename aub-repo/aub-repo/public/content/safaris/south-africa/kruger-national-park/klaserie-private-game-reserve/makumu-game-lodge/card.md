# Makumu Game Lodge
## Klaserie Private Game Reserve
### Makumu Game Lodge

#### Experience
Makumu means ‘endless view’ in the Xitsonga language.  It is therefore not surprising that Makumu Game Lodge in the Klaserie Private Nature Reserve is an intimate oasis surrounded by breathtaking views over an unspoilt African bush.
This Big 5 game reserve shares an unfenced border with the Kruger National Park, allowing game to move freely through the region, providing guests with excellent wildlife sightings away from the masses.

#### Stay
Makumu Game Lodge boasts 6 luxurious &amp; beautifully appointed suites, accommodating a maximum of 12 guests. 
Inspired by Bushman, Ndebele &amp; Zulu tribes of Africa, the suites are decorated with their own unique character.  The 3 larger suites are called King suites, &amp; the 2 smaller suites are Impi suites.
Some of these suites have hammocks, some overlook the dry riverbed &amp; others the waterhole.  
The main area at Makumu features a dining room, lounge, bar, gym &amp; swimming pool.

#### Activities
Game viewing at Makumu is opportunistic, with no time constraints nor schedules.  The rangers &amp; trackers here are highly skilled &amp; offer day &amp; night drives, walking, tracking &amp; quiet observation from the photographic hide.
This photographic bunker is sunken below ground &amp; overlooks the waterhole, offering guests the opportunity to photograph wildlife coming to the water to cool down or drink.
