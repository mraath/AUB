# Sanbona Explorer Camp
## Sanbona Wildlife Reserve
### Sanbona Explorer Camp

#### Experience
Sanbona Wildlife Reserve boasts 3 luxury lodges &amp; 1 adventure camp:  Sanbona Dwyka Tented Lodge, Sanbona Tilney Manor, Sanbona Gondwana Family Lodge &amp; Sanbona Explorer Camp.
Sanbona Explorer Camp, as the name suggests, is a guided walking experience exploring Little Karoo’s best Big 5 wildlife reserve.
With set departures on Fridays, this 2-night adventure safari offers guests an opportunity to sleep in luxury, mobile tents – unfenced &amp; authentic – the way a safari should be!
Sanbona Explorer Camp is seasonal &amp; operates in summer (October to April), ensuring guests experience only the best in wildlife viewing.  (Regrettably, no persons younger than 16 years are allowed to participate in the wilderness trail walks &amp; restrictions apply to persons over 60 years.)
The cherry on top is that Sanbona Explorer is situated only a 3-hour drive from Cape Town, making this an ideal safari choice for adventurous guests visiting the Western Cape.

#### Stay
What is better than sleeping in luxury, mobile tents &amp; dining under a canopy of stars around a campfire?  
Explorer Camp is small &amp; intimate, offering only 3 canvas tents that can sleep a maximum of 2 people each.  Since the camp is so small, guests have the option to book it exclusively.   
Each tent includes 2 stretcher beds.  En-suite facilities are available on request with a bucket shower, a chemical toilet &amp; a canvas basin.  The camp also boasts a relaxing hammock nestled away under a tree.
Totally unfenced, wild animals can move through the camp at any time &amp; although safety precautions have been followed in setting up the camp, this remains a reality.

#### Activities
At Sanbona Explorer Camp, the focus is on guided walking safaris.  Apart from walks, guests can also enjoy sundowners in the bush, stargazing, dinners around the campfire &amp; relaxing time in the camp’s hammock.
