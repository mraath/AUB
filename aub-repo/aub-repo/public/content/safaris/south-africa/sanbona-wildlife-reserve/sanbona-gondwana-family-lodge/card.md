#### Experience
Sanbona Wildlife Reserve boasts 3 luxury lodges &amp; 1 adventure camp:  Sanbona Dwyka Tented Lodge, Sanbona Tilney Manor, Sanbona Gondwana Family Lodge &amp; Sanbona Explorer Camp.
Sanbona Gondwana Family Lodge, as the name suggests, is a haven for families (or friends) &amp; overlooks the spectacular Anysberg Mountains &amp; Bellair Dam.  
Not only is the lodge located in a malaria-free Big 5 wildlife reserve, but it also boasts interleading rooms, a child-friendly pool as well as indoor &amp; outdoor play areas.  Kids are a big deal at Gondwana &amp; their dedicated Kids Programme includes children of all ages.  
The cherry on top is that the lodge is situated only a 3-hour drive from Cape Town, making this an ideal safari choice for guests visiting the Western Cape.

#### Stay
There are several room options at Gondwana Family Lodge.  Six suites are located on the ground floor &amp; have private decks with beautiful views over the bush.  There are also 6 upstairs suites with private balconies looking out over the bushveld.
Each of the 12 suites can accommodate a maximum of 2 adults &amp; 1 child. (The child will be accommodated on a sleeper couch.)  Four pairs of suites are interleading, which makes them ideal for families traveling with young children.
Each suite has an en-suite bathroom with a shower, a free-standing bath &amp; twin basins.
Communal areas include a comfortable lounge with fireplace, an indoor &amp; outdoor dining area, an open-air boma, an outdoor pool with a shallow area &amp; a children’s playroom.  There is also a gift boutique &amp; a Relaxation Retreat with a steam room.
