### The Owners Cottage at Grande Provence

#### Experience
At the foot of the Franschhoek mountains on a 300-year-old estate in South Africa’s gourmet capital, lies The Owner’s Cottage at Grande Provence.
This traditional Cape Dutch style villa is set on a working wine estate &amp; surrounded by beautiful vineyards &amp; majestic mountains.
The villa comes complete with a dedicated chef, butler &amp; babysitter, offering discerning travellers an intimate &amp; personalised Winelands escape with only the highest level of service.  
Just around the corner in the ‘French corner’ of Franschhoek, you will find a selection of wine estates, award-winning restaurants, boutiques &amp; art galleries, so guests can enjoy relaxing strolls through this quaint &amp; scenic town.
The vibrant city of Cape Town is only an hour’s drive away, so this villa makes an ideal combination with a Cape Town &amp; Whale Coast holiday.

#### Stay
The Owner’s Cottage at Grande Provence sleeps 10 guests in 5 beautifully appointed suites, offering guests elegant living &amp; magnificent views.
The villa comes complete with state-of-the-art media technology, a classic conservatory that is ideal for indoor dining &amp; an exquisite, manicured garden.  The private swimming pool &amp; rooftop spa pool are the ideal places to unwind after a day of wine tasting.  Your dedicated chef will serve gourmet feasts alfresco under the stars.
Grande Provence is also home to the two-bedroom La Provencale Vineyard Villa that can be booked on an exclusive-use basis for 4 guests, or together with The Owner’s Cottage for larger travel parties.

#### Activities
