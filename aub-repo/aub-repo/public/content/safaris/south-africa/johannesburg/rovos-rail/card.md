#### Experience
Rovos Rail offers a luxury train holiday like no other.  
Apart from owning &amp; operating the most luxurious trains in the world, Rovos Rail offers guests a variety of train journeys - each ranging from 2 nights to 2 weeks.
Short train trips include travelling from Cape Town to Pretoria or north to the majestic Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe.  The longest &amp; most famous route is an epic rail journey that starts in Cape Town &amp; passes through some of Africa’s most magnificent scenery to Dar es Salaam.
Elegant train carriages, spacious suites &amp; fine dining is what the Rovos Rail journeys are all about.  For many guests, a real highlight of their Rovos experience is the 4-course suave dinners – a jacket-&amp;-tie affair that never disappoints.
Everything is included in a Rovos Rail journey – all meals, drinks, snacks, high teas &amp; even off-train activities &amp; excursions, so guests can sit back &amp; relax in style.
Rohan Vos started Rovos Rail in 1989 (hence the name) &amp; is still very much involved in the company, endeavouring to personally welcome every guest arriving &amp; departing from Rovos’ private train station in Pretoria.
