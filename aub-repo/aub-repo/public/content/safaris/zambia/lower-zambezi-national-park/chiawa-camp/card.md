On the banks of the mighty Zambezi River, in the heart of the wildlife-rich Lower Zambezi National Park in Zambia, lies the luxurious Chiawa Camp.

All tents enjoy spectacular views over the Zambezi River.
Each tent is about 100 sq metres &amp; boasts its very own “bench wallow” which in cool weather is a sunken lounge area &amp; in hot weather, a plunge pool on demand that fills after just a couple of minutes at the turn of a tap &amp; empties at the push of a button.
The safari suite redefines the term ‘luxury’ &amp; is perched high above the Zambezi River, offering commanding views.  Ideal for honeymooners or families, the suite offers a king bedroom, a lounge (that converts into a second bedroom), an inter-leading bathroom with bath, indoor &amp; outdoor shower, a dining room &amp; lounge with fireplace as well as a 16 sq meter pool.
