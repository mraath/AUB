### Lower Zambezi National Park

#### Experience
The Lower Zambezi National Park – one of Zambia’s premier safari destinations – is set along the northern bank of the Zambezi River &amp provides serious riverfront game viewing as well as a host of exciting land &amp water-based activities.
Zimbabwe’s Mana Pools is set opposite the Zambezi River, so together these 2 parks form an unbeatable wildlife-rich region, where the 120km-riverfront takes centre stage.
Lower Zambezi National Park is still wonderfully undeveloped, with only a handful of intimate lodges &amp tented camps scattered along the water’s edge. This prime setting delivers wonderful views of the Zambezi River where hippos &amp crocodiles are found in huge numbers &amp where large herds of elephants &amp buffaloes gather to quench their thirst.
In the open grasslands, away from the river, you will find the hunting grounds for lion, wild dog &amp spotted hyena while birdlife in the park is a feast for the eyes.

#### Activities
Since most of the lodges &amp tented camps are set on the banks of the Zambezi River, guests can enjoy land &amp water-based safari activities.
These include open 4x4 game drives, thrilling night drives, guided walking safaris, river cruises, canoeing &amp fishing.

#### When to travel
The best time to travel to Lower Zambezi National Park is during the dry season, which is from May to October. Animals will gather around the Zambezi River &amp the grass is low, so it is easier to spot wildlife. This also coincides with Victoria Falls’ best travel season, so you can easily combine these 2 destinations &amp experience the best of both worlds.
Note that much of the Lower Zambezi National Park gets flooded during the wet summer season (from November to April), so many camps are closed during this time &amp reopen after the rains have ended in April.
