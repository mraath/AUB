### Livingstone

#### Experience
Zambia’s Livingstone is not only known as Africa’s adventure capital but is home to one of the continent’s biggest attractions: the majestic Victoria Falls that clocks in at twice the height of Niagra Falls.
The Victoria Falls, also referred to as the “Mosi-oa-Tunya” by the local community, lives up to its name as ‘The smoke that Thunders’. This extraordinary waterfall is not only listed as one of the 7 Natural Wonders of the World, but it also forms the largest curtain of water on the planet &amp can be viewed from both Zambian &amp Zimbabwean sides.
Livingstone offers guests the rare opportunity to swim at Devils’ Pool - the edge of the thundering Vic Falls – a bucket list experience that should be added to everyone’s list!
Accommodation in Livingstone is usually geared towards the discerning traveller who is looking for luxury accommodation in Zambia as a base from which to explore. A range of elegant lodges &amp boutique hotels offers bed &amp breakfast options while some also include activities over a 3-night stay.
Visitors to Livingstone can also walk across to the Zimbabwean side &amp view the iconic Victoria Falls from both countries. (visa needed upon arrival)

#### Activities
Plenty of fun-filled activities are available in Zambia. These include helicopter flights over the Falls, swimming at Devils’ Pool, Livingstone island lunches, romantic sunset boat cruises, river rafting, canoeing &amp exciting elephant interactions.
For anyone who longs to view The Victoria Falls from the air, a scenic helicopter or microlight flight is usually a highlight!

#### When to travel
The best time to visit the spectacular Victoria Falls is during ‘High Water’ season - from February to July, directly after the region's summer rains, when you'll see the world's largest sheet of falling water flowing at its greatest volume.
‘Low Water’ runs between August &amp January &amp is at its lowest between November &amp early December. This is the time when there is very little spray &amp visitors can fully appreciate the geological formation of Victoria Falls &amp the full length &amp breadth of them. River rafting &amp swimming at Devi’s Pool are wonderful activities to experience during low season.
