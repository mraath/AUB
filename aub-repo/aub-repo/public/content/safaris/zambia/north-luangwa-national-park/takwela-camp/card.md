# Takwela Camp
## North Luangwa National Park
### Takwela Camp

#### Experience
North Luangwa National Park is Africa’s best-kept secret.  In this off-the-beaten-track Zambian reserve, there are only a handful of lodges, including Takwela Camp.
Game viewing is conducted in 4x4 game drives &amp; on walking safaris with experienced &amp; professional guides &amp; trackers – in fact, some of the best in the country!
Guests can be on the lookout for hyena, puku, wildebeest, eland &amp; the frequently spotted lion &amp; buffalo.  The camp is only open during the best game viewing months, from June to October.

#### Stay
Small &amp; intimate, Takwela has only 2 chalets sleeping 4 guests in total.  It is therefore easy to book the camp on an exclusive use basis.  
The chalets are more rustic than luxurious, similar to those found at sister camp, Mwaleshi.  The bedrooms open up to views of the river &amp; en-suite facilities include an open-air shower.
Communal spaces at Takwela Camp are pleasantly rustic too.  They include lounge &amp; dining areas, both with river views.  There is also a fire pit where guests love to gather for breakfast &amp; pre-dinner drinks.

#### Activities
The focus at Takwela Camp is exploring the bush in open 4x4 safari vehicles as well as on foot with armed &amp; professional guides.  
This is an unfenced property in a wildlife-rich area, so wildlife viewing also frequently happens in or around camp.
