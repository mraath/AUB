# Time + Tide Mchenja
## South Luangwa National Park
### Time + Tide Mchenja

#### Experience
Mchenja – the local name for ebony – is nestled into a shady ebony grove beside the beautiful Luangwa River in the world-renowned South Luangwa National Park.
There are no other camps for miles around &amp; it is here where you will find one of the densest concentrations of game in Africa - including elephant, hippo, lion, leopard, wild dog, giraffe, wildebeest &amp; 400 species of birds.
Time + Tide Mchenja is the perfect blend between luxury &amp; adventure – the ideal choice for those looking to have an authentic safari experience without sacrificing their everyday comforts.

#### Stay
Mchenja offers 5 naturally elegant hut-style chalets which have been built from thatch &amp; grass.  One of these units is a 2-bedroom, 2-bathroom family suite, ideal for parents travelling with young children.  
Each open-plan en-suite bathroom has a bathtub looking out onto the river.  
Built around a bent ebony trunk to convey the feeling of being in a treehouse, the main area consists of a lounge, dining room, bar &amp; firepit where most evenings are spent sharing interesting stories.
There is also a refreshing pool overlooking the river – a popular hang-out between safari activities.

#### Activities
Activities at Luwi include day &amp; night drives in open 4x4 vehicles in search of Africa’s fiercest predators as well as guided walking safaris where a qualified tracker will share his expert knowledge of the bush. 
In season, this is one of the best camps in South Luangwa for seeing carmine bee-eaters.
Guests can also sleep out under the stars if they are feeling adventurous.
