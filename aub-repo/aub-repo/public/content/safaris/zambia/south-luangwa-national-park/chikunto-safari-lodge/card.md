# Chikunto Safari Lodge
## South Luangwa National Park
### Chikunto Safari Lodge

#### Experience
Chikunto Safari Lodge enjoys a fantastic location amongst rolling plains, plateaus, riverbanks &amp; miombo vegetation in Zambiaâ€™s South Luangwa National Park.
The lodge is renowned for its surviving wildlife species, providing breathtaking scenery &amp; game viewing right from its sweeping terrace!
Because the lodge &amp; tents are built on raised platforms, breathtaking vistas can be enjoyed from the viewing decks.

#### Stay
There are only 5 luxury tents at Chikunto Safari Lodge that are raised on 2m high wooden decks overlooking the Luangwa River.  One of these is a family suite that can sleep 4 people comfortably.
Each tent has an en-suite bathroom &amp; door windows that allow uninterrupted views of the river &amp; the wildlife at the banks.
The communal area at Chikunto incorporates a dining area, bar, lounge under a thatch roof, firepit &amp; salt-water swimming pool with a counter-current system for those who want to do some exercise.

#### Activities
Activities at Chukunto Safari Lodge include open 4x4 game drives with experienced guides as well as guided walking safaris where guests can explore the bush on foot &amp; learn more about local fauna &amp; flora.
February to April is a lovely time to explore the Luangwa River by boat.  During this time, the bush is lush &amp; birders flock to the Luangwa Valley.
