### Shawa Luangwa Camp

#### Experience
Named after Wanderlust’s top 8 best professional guides, Jacob Shawa, Shawa Luangwa Camp overlooks the beautiful Luangwa River &amp; was handpicked by Jacob Shawa as the ideal safari spot to explore one the park’s most untouched areas.
South Luangwa National Park is part of the Luangwa Valley – a complex ecosystem that consists of dramatic seasonal changes, lush vegetation &amp; prolific wildlife – the perfect recipe for guests to fall in love with the Zambian wilderness.
As the birthplace of the walking safari, guests will be happy to know that they can go on exhilarating walking safaris with Jacob Shawa himself – one of the best guides in Africa.
The area is not only a renowned predator playground but is also home to large herds of elephants &amp; buffaloes as well as a sizeable leopard population.

#### Stay
Shawa Luangwa Camp boasts 5 elegant safari tents, set on the banks of the Luangwa River.  All tents are raised above the ground on wooden stilts, which lessons their impact on the environment.
Each safari tent opens entirely on 3 sides to offer uninterrupted 270-degree views over the Luangwa River &amp; beyond.  Two of the 5 tents can convert into a spacious family tent.
The main area includes a dining area &amp; sparkling swimming pool where relaxing afternoons can be spent.

#### Activities
With a strong focus on the environment, electric Land Cruisers are powered by Zambia’s abundant sunshine to traverse the area quietly, lightly &amp; with minimal carbon footprint.
Other activities include exciting boating safaris on the river &amp; guided walking safaris with some of the best guides in Africa.
