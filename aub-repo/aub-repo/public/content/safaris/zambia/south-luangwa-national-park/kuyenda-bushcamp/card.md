# Kuyenda Bushcamp
## South Luangwa National Park
### Kuyenda Bushcamp

#### Experience
Kuyenda Bushcamp is situated on the banks of the Manzi River in South Luangwa National Park.  
This remote location in Zambia is home to an abundance of game, offering guests a wild &amp; unspoilt safari experience.
Kuyenda is known for its walking safaris, warm hospitality &amp; simple comforts in traditional Zambian huts.
The camp is only open from June to November, during prime wildlife season.

#### Stay
There are only 4 thatch huts set on the edge of a grassy plain, surrounded by the seemingly out-of-place palm trees.  
Each hut has an en-suite bathroom, open to the stars above &amp; panoramic windows with beautiful views over the bush &amp; animals that so often make their way through camp.
The main area features a lounge &amp; bar area overlooking the grassy plains.

#### Activities
Walking safaris are the focus at Kuyenda, although open 4x4 game drives are also offered for guests interested to go further afield or look for nocturnal animals with a spotlight.
