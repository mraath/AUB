### Busanga Bush Camp

#### Experience
One of only a handful of lodges in the wild Kafue National Park, Busanga Bush Camp enjoys an island location surrounded by seasonal floodplains &amp; waterways – the Busanga Plains.
The camp attracts honeymooners who love Busanga’s private, romantic tents with their open-air bathrooms as well as bird lovers &amp; other nature enthusiasts looking for an off-the-beaten-track safari experience.
The birdlife here is spectacular!  Guests can go on specialized birding walks, guided walking safaris &amp; canoe trips to look for fish eagles, huge flocks of waterbirds &amp; waders, cranes, herons &amp; a plethora of other species.

#### Stay
Due to Busanga Bush Camp’s small size – only 4 tents – the camp is ideal for exclusive use bookings.  Friends or families travelling together can enjoy a private safari experience in a remote wilderness setting.
Each Meru-style tent opens onto a private veranda with a hammock on one side &amp; an open-air en-suite bathroom with a shower on the other.  Each tent has 2 queen-size beds, an ideal fit for families who want to stay together.
The main area includes a canvas-covered lounge, a bar overlooking the grassy plains &amp; a small library.

#### Activities
Busanga Bush Camp includes a variety of activities, including game drives, night drives in search of nocturnal animals, hot air balloon safaris with champagne breakfast, boating on the Busanga Plains &amp; specialised birding safaris.
