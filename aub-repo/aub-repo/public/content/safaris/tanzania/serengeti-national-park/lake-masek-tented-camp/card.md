### Lake Masek Tented Camp

#### Experience
With the Ngorongoro Conservation Area on the one side &amp; the southern Serengeti on the other, Lake Masek Tented Camp’s ideal location promises exceptional year-round Big 5 game viewing &amp; access to the annual Wildebeest Migration from roughly December to April each year.
The camp is set on the edge of Lake Masek, offering jaw-dropping views over the water &amp; distant mountain peaks.  
Animals like elephant, flamingo &amp; a variety of birds are frequently seen drinking or playing in the water – so guests will have front row seats to this magical wildlife show.
The annual Wildebeest Migration can usually be seen in this area after the spring rains between December &amp; March each year.  And during this time, the mega-herds congregate to calve, which attracts an abundance of cheetah, leopard, lion &amp; hyena.

#### Stay
Accommodation at Lake Masek Tented Camp comprises 20 luxury tented suites &amp; 6 family units, all of them boasting spectacular lake views.
Each luxury tent features an en-suite bathroom with a bathtub &amp; outdoor shower, a sitting space &amp; a private veranda with safari chairs – the perfect spot to relax after a day out in the bush.
Each family unit consists of 2 inter-connected rooms under canvas with en-suite facilities &amp; private verandas.
The main camp houses a comfortable lounge, library, dining area &amp; wooden viewing deck overlooking Lake Masek.

#### Activities
A wide range of safari activities is available at Lake Masek Tented Camp.
