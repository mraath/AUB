### Serengeti Serena Safari Lodge

#### Experience
Adjacent to the renowned Wester Corridor &amp; Grumeti River, Serengeti Serena Lodge is set on a ridge overlooking the game-rich Serengeti Plains, creating the perfect blend between traditional African architecture &amp; stylish comfort.
Its unusual bungalow-type huts will immediately catch your eye upon arrival – specifically designed to remind guests to kick off their shoes, because they are now in Africa!
This region of the Serengeti is home to the famous Big 5 – lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo &amp; rhino - &amp; guests will not only have the chance to spot all of its members but may also witness the Great Migration – when millions of wildebeest trek across the plains in pursuit of greener pastures.

#### Stay
There are 65 chalets &amp; 1 suite at Serengeti Serena Safari Lodge, all built-in clusters of traditional ‘rondavels’ arranged around the lodge’s infinity pool.
Each double-storey rondavel has 3 rooms, each with an en-suite bathroom &amp; private balcony or terrace.  
The stylish suite is set slightly apart from the other chalets to afford maximum privacy.  This suite features a sitting room boasting uninterrupted views over the wilderness.
Communal areas at Serengeti Serena Safari Lodge include a dining room, bar &amp; swimming pool overlooking the seemingly endless savannah plains.  There is also a safari boutique where guests can stock up on beautiful African décor items.

#### Activities
A wide range of safari activities is available at Serengeti Serena Safari Lodge.
These include open 4x4 game drives with a qualified ranger, guided bush walks, hot air balloon safaris, bird watching, cooking lessons &amp; bush picnics.
