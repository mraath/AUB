### Dunia Camp

#### Experience
The boutique-style Dunia Camp is set on a major seasonal Wildebeest Migration route in Tanzania’s central Serengeti.
This intimate mobile tented camp not only promises front row seats to the largest wildlife spectacle on Earth but provides phenomenal year-round wildlife viewing in the central &amp; southern Serengeti.
Dunia Camp is situated near the striking Moru Kopjes &amp; a rhino conservation area, which means that guests have an opportunity to spend time with these magnificent creatures.
In season, the annual migration passes through the area where Dunia Camp is located, attracting the attention of big cats such as lion, leopard &amp; cheetah.

#### Stay
Dunia Camp boasts 7 luxury safari tents &amp; 1 family tent, all raised on wooden platforms overlooking the wilderness.
Each tent has an en-suite bathroom with plumbed shower &amp; flushable toilet as well as a private veranda where morning coffee can be enjoyed.
The family tent consists of 2 bedrooms, both with an en-suite bathroom &amp; a large, shared veranda with views out towards the kopjes.
The main dining tent includes a well-stocked library &amp; a safari bar where delicious pre-dinner drinks are served.  There is also a crackling outdoor campfire where interesting safari stories are shared.

#### Activities
A variety of exciting safari activities are available at Dunia Camp.
These include open 4x4 game drives, thrilling hot air balloon safaris over the vast Serengeti plains, wilderness picnics, bush dining, sundowner excursions, village visits &amp; children’s activities.
