### Serengeti National Park

#### Experience
Home to the iconic Great Wildebeest Migration, the Serengeti boasts one of the world's largest wildlife concentrations and is the habitat of the coveted Big 5: lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo, &amp rhino. Its year-round sensational game viewing is unparalleled.
This flagship Tanzanian conservation area encompasses vast rolling grasslands &amp golden savannahs, providing visitors with a profound sense of space &amp some of Africa's finest game encounters. Wildlife enthusiasts flock to the Serengeti to witness nature's grand spectacle: The Great Wildebeest Migration. Every year, millions of wildebeest, zebras, &amp gazelles follow a migratory path across the Serengeti in search of greener pastures. Observing massive herds braving crocodile-infested rivers &amp eluding hungry predators like Africa's big cats is the essence of the Serengeti experience.
Throughout the year, expect extraordinary wildlife encounters, including the exhilarating predator-prey drama of calving season (February to March).

#### Activities
Serengeti National Park offers a wide array of wildlife-centered activities, including open 4x4 game drives, guided walks, captivating hot air balloon safaris, &amp rewarding birdwatching. Cultural visits, delightful picnic lunches, invigorating mountain biking, &amp horse riding are among the other thrilling pursuits available.

#### When to travel
For optimal wildlife viewing, plan your visit during the dry season from late June to October. This period not only offers superb wildlife encounters but also showcases the pinnacle of the Wildebeest Migration. While wildlife viewing is excellent year-round, specific areas shine during different times. Keep in mind that the entire migration is orchestrated by rainfall. Here's a brief overview:
JANUARY: Herds move south to the area near Lake Ndutu.
FEBRUARY &  MARCH: Calving season unfolds, with thousands of wildebeest calves born daily.
APRIL & MAY: Herds move northwest toward the Moru & Simba Kopjes.
JUNE: They reach the central Serengeti, preparing for the challenging journey ahead.
JULY: The herds arrive in the Grumeti region, confronting the crocodile-infested waters of the Mara River.
AUGUST: Witness thrilling river crossings from the northern Serengeti to the Masai Mara.
SEPTEMBER: Herds break into smaller groups, with most crossing to the Masai Mara while a portion remains in the northern Serengeti.
OCTOBER: In October, the best time for wildlife viewing is in the Masai Mara in Kenya. Opt to stay in one of the less-crowded private conservancies where off-road driving & night drives are permitted.
NOVEMBER: Normally, the short rains begin in November - tempting the wildebeest to leave the dry Mara for the rejuvenated Serengeti. Generally, they can be seen in the Serengeti’s northeastern region where they may split into smaller groups before continuing their journey southward.
DECEMBER: In December, the herds move south towards fresh grazing & cover the northern & eastern Serengeti in preparation for another action-packed 3,000 km journey.
