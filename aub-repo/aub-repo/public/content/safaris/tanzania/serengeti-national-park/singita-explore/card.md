## Serengeti National Park
### Singita Explore

#### Experience
Singita Grumeti, an exclusive mobile tented camp, is set within the 350,000-acre Grumeti concession that forms part of the Serengeti ecosystem in Tanzania.
The camp moves around during the year to follow one of Earth’s greatest spectacles:  The Great Wildebeest Migration.
With an ideal location on the migratory route traversed annually by more than a million wildebeest, Singita Grumeti never fails to impress.
Since the camp can only be booked on an exclusive-use basis, each group will have a private guide, safari vehicle, chef &amp; staff – an ideal option for families or friends in search of an intimate &amp; luxurious – yet authentic - safari experience. 
No set schedules are adhered to at Singita Explore.  Instead, safari itineraries are tailored to suit each group’s needs &amp; preferred activities.

#### Stay
Singita Explore offers up to 6 one-bedroom custom-designed tents configured to suit the group.  
Designed for private use, all stylish tents feature en-suite bathrooms, reading areas &amp; private viewing decks boasting breathtaking views over the African wilderness.
The mess tent includes an open plan lounge, dining area, library &amp; inviting swimming pool.

#### Activities
Singita Explore offers a range of exciting safari activities.
These include open 4x4 game drives with a qualified ranger, thrilling hot air balloon safaris &amp; community visits to local Maasai villages.
Singita’s Online Wine Cellar is also available should guests wish to purchase some of the most sought-after vintage wines the continent has to offer.
