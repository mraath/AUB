## Serengeti National Park
### Mkombe's House Lamai

#### Experience
Mkombe’s House is named after the legendary Tanzanian guide, Mkombo Mniko, who connected strongly with children - &amp; their parents.  
This private safari villa is set within one of the richest areas of the Serengeti &amp; has been designed to give families a home-away-from-home safari experience.
The villa has everything a family needs - from cots, cribs, high chairs &amp; babysitting services to a plunge pool &amp; large swimming pool overlooking the Lamai Wedge &amp; the Mara River Valley – the site of the iconic Wildebeest Migration river crossings from about July to October.

#### Stay
Mkombe’s House comprises 2 main en-suite bedrooms, &amp; each has an adjoining en-suite room for children, meaning it can sleep 4 adults &amp; 6 children of all ages in complete comfort.
The villa features a main dining room, lounge, a spacious deck with plenty of outdoor seating, a plunge pool, a larger swimming pool &amp; sweeping views of the surrounding grasslands.
Since the villa is booked for exclusive stays only, guests will have dedicated staff, including an in-house chef &amp; a private guide who will take care of your every need.

#### Activities
Since each group is assigned a private safari vehicle &amp; guide, guests can explore the bush at their own pace, without succumbing to a set safari schedule.
Safari activities at Mkombe’s House include open 4x4 game drives, guided bush walks, private dining &amp; plenty of fun-filled activities for the little ones.
