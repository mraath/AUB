# Sayari Camp
## Serengeti National Park
### Sayari Camp

#### Experience
The award-winning Sayari Camp boasts a remote setting in Tanzania’s northern Serengeti.
Stylish &amp; exclusive, this tented camp offers awe-inspiring views over the game-rich Serengeti plains – a big plus during Migration season when millions of wildebeest, zebra &amp; gazelle pass through the area in front of the camp, in search of greener pastures.
Its ideal location close to the Mara River ensures that guests have easy access to multiple Wildebeest Migration crossing points. (June – October)
Outside of migration season, superb Big 5 game viewing - including predators like cheetah &amp; hyena - can be expected.

#### Stay
Sayari has 13 stylish tented suites, 1 two-bedroom family tent &amp; 1 honeymoon tent.
Each tent is equipped with an en-suite bathroom complete with a walk-in shower &amp; lavish egg-shaped bathtub that overlooks the plains.
Beautiful private verandas offer peace &amp; tranquillity after a day of bush exploration.
The family tented suite is suitable for 2 adults &amp; 3 children under the age of 16.  The main bedroom is identical to the double tents &amp; linked to the kids’ room by a raised platform complete with safety railings.  The second bedroom has an en-suite bathroom with a walk-in shower &amp; a private veranda with gorgeous views.
Designed to provide luxury &amp; comfort, the honeymoon tent boasts an en-suite bathroom with an indoor shower, free-standing bath &amp; a romantic outdoor shower.  The private wooden deck with a large sofa/day bed is the perfect place to relax in between safari activities.
The main lodge features a lounge, dining area, bar, spa &amp; infinity pool offering glorious views over the Serengeti.
