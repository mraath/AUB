# Namiri Plains
## Serengeti National Park
### Namiri Plains

#### Experience
The ultra-luxurious Namiri Plains is set within a remote corner in the eastern Serengeti – an area that was closed to tourists for 20 years to allow the cheetah population to restore itself.  Today, big cats can safely wander its plains.
‘Namiri’ in Swahili means ‘big cat’ - &amp; aptly so, because this stylish safari camp offers some of East Africa’s best cheetah sightings.
Namiri Plains is so remote, it is located more than an hour’s drive from any other camp in the region, offering guests an exclusive, intimate safari experience.
Each year, one of nature’s greatest spectacles take place in East Africa:  The Great Wildebeest Migration.  And Namiri guests have front row seats to this magical wildlife show.  
Because this area is home to an abundance of predators, the plot thickens as lucky guests can witness cheetah, lion, leopard &amp; hyena stalk &amp; hunt their prey.

#### Stay
Accommodation at Namiri Plains consists of 10 elegant tented suites &amp; 1 family tent, all with sweeping 360-degree views of the plains.  
Substantial in size, each tented suite offers sliding doors which run the full length of the room &amp; open out on a full-length viewing deck complete with a romantic outdoor bath, offering exceptional views from the tub as you relax.  
From the shower, guests can enjoy full views of the seasonal riverbed.
The family tent is similar to the other tent, but slightly larger &amp; comes with an additional room with 2 single beds in it, which can be made into a double.
The communal mess tent offers beautiful views of the captivating Serengeti plains &amp; features a lounge, dining space, safari bar &amp; spa.

#### Activities
Safari activities at Namiri Plains include open 4x4 game drives, guided bush walks, hot air balloon safaris, photographic excursions &amp; visiting the cheetah research project.
