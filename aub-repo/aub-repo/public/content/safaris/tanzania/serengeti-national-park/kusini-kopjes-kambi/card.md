## Serengeti National Park
### Kusini Kopjes Kambi

#### Experience
As the name suggests, Kusini Kopjes Kambi is built on a hilltop (‘kopjes’ means ‘a small, rocky hill’), overlooking the game-rich plains of the southern Serengeti.
The southern Serengeti is where the annual Wildebeest Migration enters one of its most dramatic stages.  During a 2- or 3- month period (from about January to March), wildebeest calves are born here in their tens of thousands, attracting predators ranging from big cats &amp; wild dogs to hyenas &amp; jackals.
During this time of year, wildlife viewing is exceptional as it offers wonderful opportunities to see predator-prey interactions.
Not only is the southern Serengeti a wildlife paradise during the Great Migration, but excellent year-round Big 5 game viewing can be expected.  Cheetah sightings are also common.

#### Stay
Kusini Kopjes Kambi comprises 12 tented suites, including a secluded honeymoon suite – all dotted along the edge of a hill.
Each tent features a lounge area with comfortable chairs, an en-suite bathroom with a lavish bathtub &amp; outdoor rain shower &amp; a private terrace offering beautiful views of the surrounding landscape.
The main camp has a traditional safari camp layout, comprising of a lounge, dining area &amp; bar, flowing out onto raised wooden decking overlooking the Serengeti.

#### Activities
Thrilling morning &amp; afternoon game drives take you to the heart of the action, especially when the migration passes through between December &amp; April &amp; then again in July &amp; August.
Guests can also enjoy guided bush walks &amp; hot air balloon safaris over the vast Serengeti plains.
