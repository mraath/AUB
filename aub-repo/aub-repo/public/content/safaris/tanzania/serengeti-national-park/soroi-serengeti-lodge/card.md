### Soroi Serengeti Lodge

#### Experience
Soroi Serengeti Lodge is perched on a rocky hill in the western corridor of the renowned Serengeti National Park in Tanzania.
With sweeping views as far as the eye can see, Soroi Serengeti Lodge offers a tranquil haven from which to enjoy one of nature’s greatest spectacles:  The Great Wildebeest Migration.
In season, guests can witness how millions of wildebeest, zebra &amp; gazelle move through the area in search of greener pastures.
Its prime hilltop location ensures breathtaking sunsets over the vast plains of Musabi &amp; therefore it is not surprising that Soroi Serengeti is a popular choice among honeymooners &amp; romantics.

#### Stay
There are 25 chalets in total, of which 20 are safari chalets (2 are family chalets) &amp; 5 are luxury suites.  All chalets &amp; suites offer spectacular views over the vast Musabi plains.
The chalets feature large expanses of glass, spacious viewing decks, well-appointed en-suite bathrooms with a stand-alone bath, &amp; for the more adventurous – an outdoor shower.
In addition, the spacious luxury suites each offer an extended lounge area.
The thatched &amp; wooden main lounge area includes a small library, large deck with infinity pool, safari bar &amp; crackling firepit.

#### Activities
A range of exciting safari activities is available at Soroi Serengeti Lodge.  
These include open 4x4 game drives with a qualified ranger &amp; thrilling hot air balloon safaris over the vast plains of the Serengeti.  Post balloon champagne breakfasts are always a highlight.
Guests can also take a refreshing dip in the lodge’s swimming pool or enjoy relaxing spa treatments in the comfort of their room.
