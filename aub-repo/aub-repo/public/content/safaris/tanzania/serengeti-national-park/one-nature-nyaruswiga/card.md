### One Nature Nyaruswiga

#### Experience
The ultra-luxurious, yet understated One Nature Nyaruswiga, is a stylish tented camp overlooking rolling grasslands in the game-rich central Serengeti.
Embraced by the Nyaruswiga Hills, this magical destination provides an almost surreal backdrop for one of natureâ€™s greatest spectacles:  The Great Wildebeest Migration.
Each year more than a million animals migrate through this valley &amp; One Nature guests are fortunate enough to witness this magical wildlife show for the longest time.
Not only is One Nature Nyaruswiga in the middle of the wildebeest action, the camp also offers excellent year-round game viewing.

#### Stay
One Nature offers 12 one-bedroom ultra-luxurious safari tents &amp; 2 two-bedroom family suites, all harmoniously nestled into the pristine woodlands of the Nyaruswiga.  
Each tent overlooks the beautiful open savanna, &amp; any wildlife passing within miles can be seen from the comfort of the bedroom or private veranda.
The tents feature en-suite bathrooms complete with romantic free-standing copper bathtubs, as well as indoor &amp; outdoor showers.  
There are also family suites, each accommodating 5 people &amp; consisting of 2 en-suite bedrooms, separated by a spacious family living room.  The wooden deck outside offers glorious views over the sun-kissed African savannah.
The main area at One Nature includes a lounge, dining room, safari bar &amp; heated plunge pool.  There is also an astral observation deck with a large telescope.

#### Activities
One Nature Nyaruswiga offers a variety of thrilling safari activities, including open 4x4 game drives, hot air balloon safaris, bush picnics, in-room massages, stargazing opportunities, swimming &amp; romantic sundowner excursions.
