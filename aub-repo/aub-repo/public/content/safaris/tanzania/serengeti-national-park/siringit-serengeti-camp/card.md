#### Experience
Siringit Serengeti Camp is set under a canopy of trees along the iconic wildlife migration trails in Tanzania’s Serengeti National Park.
Each year, between April &amp; June, the wildebeest migration passes through camp, so guests will have front-row seats to one of Earth’s greatest wildlife spectacles!
In fact, wildlife migrates daily through camp &amp; so it is possible to enjoy superb wildlife viewing from the comfort of your tent’s veranda.
Renowned for its wealth of leopard &amp; lion sightings, Siringit Serengeti never disappoints when it comes to wildlife.  The Serengeti National Park is also home to 500 bird species, so avid birders will feel like they are in paradise.

#### Stay

Each tent is raised on a wooden platform &amp; boasts a private veranda that offers captivating views over the bush.  Tents also boast en-suite bathrooms as well as generous sleeping areas &amp; lounge spaces.
Communal areas include a comfortable lounge &amp; an extensive wooden deck with an infinity pool, a daybed &amp; an open firepit – all offering spectacular views of the bush.
