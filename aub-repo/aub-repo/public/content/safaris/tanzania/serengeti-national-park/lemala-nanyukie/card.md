### Lemala Nanyukie

#### Experience
Ideally situated near the Central Serengeti’s renowned Seronera region - an area famous for its big concentrations of lion, cheetah &amp; leopard - lies Lemala Nanyukie.
Not only does this area produce exceptional year-round wildlife viewing – including the Big 5 – it also lies directly in the path of the Great Wildebeest Migration, where millions of wildebeest move through the region between April &amp; June &amp; again from November to January.
With a perfect blend between contemporary &amp; traditional, Lemala Nanyukie is an ideal choice for the discerning traveller looking for a luxurious, yet authentic tented safari experience.

#### Stay
Accommodation comprises 10 luxury tents, 3 quadruple tents &amp; 1 two-bedroom tent – all designed for maximum privacy.
Each of the luxury tents features a spacious lounge, generous en-suite bathroom complete with outdoor shower, wooden deck with sunken seating &amp; stunning corner plunge pool with views directly across the Serengeti’s magnificent grasslands.
The quadruple tents are identical to the luxury tents but can accommodate 4 guests in extra beds.
The 2-bedroom tent is ideal for families &amp; consists of 2 en-suite bedrooms, joined by a walkway.  This unit can sleep 6 people.
The double-volume main area features a lounge, bar &amp; outdoor viewing deck with a swimming pool – the perfect spot to relax while taking in uninterrupted views of the Serengeti.

#### Activities
Safari activities include open 4x4 game drives in open safari vehicles, hot air balloon safaris over the Serengeti plains, guided walks, outdoor dining &amp; romantic sundowner excursions.
The little ones can also enjoy a range of fun-filled activities at the Kids Club.
