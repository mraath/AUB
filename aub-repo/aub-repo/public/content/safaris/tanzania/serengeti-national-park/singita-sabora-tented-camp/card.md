### Singita Sabora Tented Camp

#### Experience
The name Singita is synonymous with world-class safaris &amp; their Sabora Tented Camp is no different.  
The 1920’s style Singita Sabora is situated on the Serengeti Plains of the Grumeti Reserves.  Consisting of 400,000 acres of unrivalled wilderness, these plains form part of the iconic Great Wildebeest Migration. 
In season, guests can witness how millions of wildebeest, zebra &amp; gazelle move through the area in search of greener pastures.
Migration season aside, the Serengeti is also home to an abundance of wildlife &amp; therefore offers spectacular year-round wildlife encounters.

#### Stay
Singita Sabora offers the classic style of a bygone era, featuring 9 lavish 1920’s style safari tents.
Each en-suite tent includes a private pantry, dining &amp; fitness area, as well as a pilates deck where guests can relax &amp; immerse themselves in wellness activities.  The outdoor sala &amp; secluded day bed overlooking one of Sabora’s 2 waterholes make for uninterrupted game viewing.
The main lodge features a bar-lounge, library, gym, swimming pool, wellness spa &amp; an elevated viewing deck.

#### Activities
Activities at Singita Sabora Tented Camp include open 4x4 game drives, thrilling hot air balloon safaris over the vast Serengeti plains, guided walks &amp; night drives.
