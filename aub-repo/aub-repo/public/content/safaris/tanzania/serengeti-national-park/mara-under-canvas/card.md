### Mara Under Canvas

#### Experience
With a spectacular location in the northern Serengeti’s Mara triangle, Mara Under Canvas is where you want to be during one of nature’s greatest wildlife spectacles:  The Great Wildebeest Migration.
The closest camp to the Mara River, guests will have front row seats to one of the most intense river crossings in the migration.  Millions of wildebeest, zebra &amp; gazelle brave the crocodile-infested waters in pursuit of greener pastures - &amp; Mara Under Canvas guests are right in the middle of the action.
Safari-goers who will fall in love with Mara Under Canvas are those who don’t need silver service or spa treatments during their time on safari but prefer to focus on comfortable accommodation with a strong emphasis on wildlife encounters.

#### Stay
Small &amp; intimate, the camp features 10 traditional safari tents, ensuring guests have a classic safari experience.  
Each spacious tent has an en-suite bathroom &amp; private veranda offering glorious views over the magnificent landscape.  The tents can be set up as double, twin or triple rooms, &amp; can be interconnected to form a family suite.
The cosy mess tent hosts a dining area &amp; a beautifully decorated lounge with unmatched views of the surrounding Serengeti.  Just outside is an inviting campfire - the ideal place to relax after a day of exploring.

#### Activities
Safari activities at Mara Under Canvas include open 4x4 game drives in open safari vehicles, thrilling hot air balloon safaris over the Serengeti plains &amp; romantic sundowners in the bush.
Guests can also relax on their private verandas with a book or take a lazy afternoon siesta.
