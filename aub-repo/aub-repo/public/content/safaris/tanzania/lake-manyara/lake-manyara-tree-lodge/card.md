The exclusive Lake Manyara Tree Lodge is the only lodge in the game-rich Lake Manyara National Park &amp; offers guests a relaxing, yet adventurous safari experience.
Remote &amp; romantic, the lodge boasts an ideal setting surrounded by lush forest – home to skipping blue monkeys &amp; 400 species of birds.  Thousands of flamingos can be seen around the lake, along with migratory waterbirds like pelicans &amp; storks.
Lake Manyara offers guests a wide variety of wildlife, including the famous tree-climbing lions of East Africa as well as large herds of elephants.

#### Stay

Each treehouse suite features a generous deck suspended above the forest floor &amp; large windows invite the lush forest inside.  The en-suite bathrooms boast free-standing baths &amp; outdoor showers – both offering beautiful views.
Communal areas include a dining-bar area with a viewing deck &amp; swimming pool, an open-air boma where pre-dinner drinks can be enjoyed &amp; a wellness spa that offers a wide selection of relaxing treatments.

#### Activities
Lake Manyara Tree Lodge offers daily game viewing expeditions led by expert guides.  
Guests can enjoy open 4x4 game drives as well as fascinating night drives that provide an insight into the park’s rich nocturnal life, &amp; the chance to spot elusive creatures like aardvark &amp; bat-eared foxes.
One of the highlights at Lake Manyara is going on a cultural bicycle ride to one of the local villages, &amp; of course – ticking off many feathered favourites from their impressive bird list.
