### Rubondo Island National Park

#### Experience
Rubondo National Park, situated on an island in the southern part of Lake Victoria, the world's second-largest freshwater lake, offers a unique Tanzanian adventure that borders Kenya, Tanzania, &amp Uganda.
Although Lake Victoria covers nearly 70,000 square kilometers, it is relatively shallow &amp lacks the abundant wildlife found in other Tanzanian regions. Rubondo Island National Park, however, is a captivating exception, drawing travelers to its forested shores. Here, you'll encounter a diverse array of large game, including chimpanzees, elephants, &amp giraffes, along with an impressive birdlife featuring around 400 species.

#### Activities
Rubondo Island National Park invites nature enthusiasts to embrace the tranquility of lakeside living while partaking in various forest activities. Options include exhilarating chimpanzee trekking safaris, game drives, &amp leisurely forest walks that focus on smaller creatures &amp avian wonders. For those seeking angling adventures, catch-and-release fishing on Lake Victoria is an enticing option. Don't miss the thrill of overnight fly-camping expeditions for the more adventurous traveler.

#### When to travel
The optimal time to visit Rubondo Island National Park is during the cooler, dry season spanning from June to October. Given its tropical location, rain showers can occur on any given day. Please note that Rubondo Island Camp, the sole camp in this wild and virtually uninhabited national park, remains closed during the extended rainy period in April &amp May.
