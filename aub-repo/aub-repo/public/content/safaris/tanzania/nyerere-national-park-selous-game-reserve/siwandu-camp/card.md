#### Experience
Siwandu Camp boasts a superb location within Africa’s largest game reserve – the Nyerere National Park, (Selous Game Reserve) 
Similar in size to Switzerland &amp; 4 times the size of the Serengeti, Nyerere promises an authentic &amp; unparalleled wilderness experience in luxury tents.
The park is home to Africa’s densest lion &amp; elephant populations, as well as excellent predator sightings &amp; a variety of bird species.
Siwandu Camp is built along the shores of Lake Nzerakera, an area teeming with wildlife.  And it is here where elephant &amp; hippo are frequently spotted wandering through the camp on their way to the lake.

#### Stay
The camp is divided into 2 sections to offer an intimate atmosphere in this remote &amp; beautiful location. Accommodation comprises 13 octagonal tented suites, dotted along the shores of the lake.   
Each en-suite tent features an open-air stargazer to maximize the views.  Guests can relax on the bed or the sun loungers &amp; observe animals as they wander past.  
Each of the 2 sections of the camp has a private lounge with gorgeous views of the wilderness as well as a swimming pool, bar &amp; well-stocked library.
