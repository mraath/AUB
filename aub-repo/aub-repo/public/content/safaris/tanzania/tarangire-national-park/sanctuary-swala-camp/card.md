# Sanctuary Swala Camp
## Tarangire National Park
### Sanctuary Swala Camp

#### Experience
The secluded &amp; luxurious Sanctuary Swala Camp is situated under a canopy of large acacia trees at the edge of the Gurusi wetlands in Tarangire National Park.
With sweeping views of the rolling savannah beyond, Swala is the only camp in this part of Tarangire &amp; therefore offers an exclusive safari to discerning travellers who seek the best in wilderness luxury.
The park is home to large herds of elephants &amp; it is not surprising to see these amazing creatures pass through camp &amp; give birth nearby.  In fact, the record for elephant bulls at Swala is an astonishing 92 animals!
In the dry season, the Tarangire River becomes the area’s main lifeline, attracting an abundance of wildlife, including predators &amp; birds.  Guests can sit on the viewing deck &amp; enjoy excellent armchair game viewing without ever having to leave camp.

#### Stay
The camp boasts 12 luxury-suite tents, all overlooking a popular waterhole where animals frequently come to quench their thirst.  
Each tent has a dedicated butler that will take care of your every need.
The open-plan tents feature en-suite bathrooms with indoor &amp; outdoor bush-view showers for guests to connect with wildlife as well a private deck – the perfect place to relax after a day of exploration.
Communal areas at Sanctuary Swala Camp comprises a lounge, dining room, café-style bar &amp; sparkling swimming pool.

#### Activities
A range of exciting safari activities is available at Swala.
These include open 4x4 day &amp; night drives with qualified guides, guided walking safaris, bush picnics &amp; getting involved in the beekeeping project in the village of Mwika.
