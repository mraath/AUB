### Satao Elerai Camp

#### Experience
The eco-friendly Satao Elerai Camp is set on a 5,000-acre private conservation area on the border of Kenya’s Amboseli National Park. 
Not only does is the region a drawcard to an abundance of wildlife, but the lodge itself boasts breathtaking views over the Amboseli plains &amp; Africa’s highest peak - the majestic Mount Kilimanjaro.
Satao Elerai overlooks a busy waterhole that attracts a variety of game - especially the resident elephants - so guests can sit on the deck while watching these magnificent creatures drink, play &amp; splash around.

#### Stay
The camp comprises 5 lodge-style suites &amp; 9 deluxe mountain-facing tents, each designed with an emphasis on luxury.  All rooms have en-suite bathrooms.
The suites have large sliding doors that open onto private balconies where guests can enjoy spectacular views of the game-rich Amboseli with elephant, giraffe, zebra &amp; other plains game often spotted from the rooms.
The classic safari-style tents have thatched roofs &amp; are built on raised wooden decks, boasting beautiful views of Mount Kilimanjaro.  Each tent has a large balcony with a day bed where lazy afternoons are often spent.
The main lodge area includes a terrace overlooking the plains &amp; waterhole, an infinity pool with beautiful views over Mount Kilimanjaro, an upstairs look-out point as well as a cosy lounge, bar &amp; campfire.

#### Activities
A range of exciting safari activities is available at Satao Elerai Camp.  
These include walking safaris with Maasai warriors, open 4x4 guided game drives as well as night drives where guests can look for Africa’s sought-after nocturnal creatures with a spotlight.
