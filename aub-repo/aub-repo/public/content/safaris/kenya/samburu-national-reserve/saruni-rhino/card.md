Within this 350,000-hectare wilderness known as the Sera Community Conservancy – the first community conservancy in Africa to own &amp; operate a sanctuary for black rhino – these amazing creatures receive state-of-the-art protection &amp; can roam freely in their natural habitat.
Joined by highly trained guides who are respectful of the environment, guests can track &amp; approach black rhino on foot while observing these magnificent mammals from up close.
The reserve is also home to a variety of other game, including antelope, zebra, reticulated giraffe, buffalo, elephant &amp; a variety of bird species.
