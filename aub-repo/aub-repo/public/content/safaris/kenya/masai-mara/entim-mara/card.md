### Entim Mara

#### Experience
Entim means ‘forest’ in Maasai – aptly so, because Entim Mara boasts a spectacular setting on the edge of the riverine woodlands overlooking Kenya’s Mara River.
With an unbeatable riverfront location - the same river where over a million wildebeest, zebra &amp; antelopes cross each year – guests can witness this spectacular river crossing from the comfort of the camp’s viewing deck as well as from all the tents!
The Great Migration takes place between July &amp; October each year &amp; when the wildebeest hesitate on the riverbank for days before taking the leap.  Entim’s guests are not missing out on any of the action.  Entim guests are usually first on the scene &amp; in the middle of all the action without tourist traffic around.

#### Stay
With only 12 luxury tents, Entim Mara ensures an intimate safari experience with personalized service.  
Each tent is raised on a wooden deck overlooking the action-packed Mara River &amp; features an en-suite bathroom, private lounge &amp; veranda.
The central area includes a cosy lounge area with a small library &amp; separate bar as well as an open-fronted dining area - allowing guests to witness the unmatched experience of eating meals while watching animals move to &amp; from the river.

#### Activities
Activities at Entim Mara include open 4x4 game drives, guided bush walks, hot air balloon safaris, Maasai village visits, sundowners &amp; alfresco bush picnics.
