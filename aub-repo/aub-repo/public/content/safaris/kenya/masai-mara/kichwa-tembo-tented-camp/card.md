#### Experience
Kichwa Tembo Tented Camp, one of Kenya’s best-loved safari lodges, is set within a private concession next to the world-renowned Masai Mara &amp; lies directly in the path of Africa’s iconic Wildebeest Migration. (August – November)
Offering magical views over the Mara plains &amp; Sabaringo River, Kichwa Tembo is the ideal place from which to witness how millions of animals move between Tanzania’s Serengeti &amp; Kenya’s Masai Mara.

The classic tents are nestled in a surrounding forest, away from the main guest area &amp; provide limited views of the river.
The superior tents offer either slightly interrupted views of the Masai Mara, glimpses of the Masai Mara through the shade of the forest or picturesque scenes of a nearby escarpment.
The superior view tents are extremely spacious &amp; have private verandas with comfortable day beds &amp; uninterrupted views of the Mara.
Families will be delighted to stay in one of 3 family tents, each comprising of 2 inter-connected tents with an en-suite bathroom &amp; a private veranda.  These units can sleep 2 adults &amp; 2 children. (3 children on special request)
The communal area includes a lounge, bar &amp; swimming pool.
