# Mara Expedition Camp
## Masai Mara
### Mara Expedition Camp

#### Experience
The intimate &amp; exclusive Mara Expedition Camp enjoys an ideal forest location in the northern Masai Mara overlooking Kenya’s wildlife-rich savanna.
With an ideal location close to its sister camp – Mara Plains – the camp has a traditional safari feel with no set schedule.  Guests can set out in their own time for a day’s game viewing in the Masai Mara.
Since there are only 5 tents, it is easy to book the camp exclusively &amp; enjoy a private safari with family or friends.

#### Stay
Nestled in a riverine forest are 5 custom-designed tents of flowing canvas, each open on the horizontal side with canopied ceilings &amp; slightly raised from the ground to maximize the views.
Each tent includes an en-suite bathroom with a bucket shower &amp; flush loo as well as a private veranda, a great spot to sit &amp; absorb the beauty of the camp’s setting.
The communal area at Mara Expedition Camp includes a lounge, dining room, library &amp; bar.

#### Activities
Having no set schedule at camp allows guests to set out in their own time.
Safari activities include open 4x4 game drives into the Masai Mara, visiting the local Maasai village to learn more about their culture or relax between activities with a book from the camp’s library.
