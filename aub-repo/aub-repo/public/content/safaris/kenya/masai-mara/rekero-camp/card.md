# Rekero Camp
## Masai Mara
### Rekero Camp

#### Experience
Overlooking the beautiful Talek River in the Masa Mara Game Reserve, you will find the charming &amp; seasonal Rekero Camp.
Ideally positioned, close to 3 regular river crossing points, guests can witness the iconic Wildebeest Migration as they migrate on their annual journey across crocodile-infested waters.  
This region of the Masai Mara is also famous for being big cat territory.  Species to look forward to seeing include lion, leopard &amp; cheetah as well as elephant, black rhino &amp; hippo.

#### Stay
There are only 9 spacious safari tents at Rekero Camp (including 2 family tents), all laid out along the edge of the Talek River under a network of shady trees.
Each classic safari tent includes an en-suite bathroom &amp; a large private veranda with an inviting day bed overlooking the river.
Rekero’s main area features a lounge, dining space, bar &amp; a dedicated Wi-Fi tent.

#### Activities
A range of exhilarating safari activities is available at Rekero Camp.
These include morning &amp; afternoon game drives with an expert ranger, thrilling hot air balloon safaris over the vast Kenyan plains &amp; bush picnics.
At Rekero, guests are just 50 meters away from one of the regular Wildebeest Migration crossing points, where herds of zebra &amp; wildebeest cross the Talek River.  Families with small children will have a personal game-viewing vehicle complete with an expert guide that will keep kids entertained with interesting stories.
