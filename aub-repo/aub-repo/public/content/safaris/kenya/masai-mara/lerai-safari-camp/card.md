#### Experience
Lerai Safari Camp is the only permanent safari lodge in the 5,000-acre Olerai Conservancy, which forms part of the greater Masai Mara ecosystem in southern Kenya.
With an excellent location just west of the Masai Mara &amp; 15 miles north of the Serengeti, Lerai Safari Camp boasts magnificent views over the game-packed plains, which is home to the highest number of giraffe &amp; eland in the region.

#### Stay
The camp is small &amp; intimate, ensuring a boutique-type safari experience in a wild &amp; remote setting.  There are only 6 elegant safari tents made from canvas, each equipped with an en-suite bathroom.
The camps’ main area includes a lounge, bar &amp; dining area which overlooks the vast plains &amp; seasonal river.

#### Activities
Camp activities at Lerai include day &amp; night game drives with professional rangers, walking safaris, hot air balloon rides over the game-packed plains, excursions to Maasai villages, horse riding as well as breakfast &amp; lunch in the bush.
