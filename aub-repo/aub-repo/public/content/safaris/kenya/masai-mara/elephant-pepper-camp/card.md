# Elephant Pepper Camp
## Masai Mara
### Elephant Pepper Camp

#### Experience
Elephant Pepper Camp, a traditional tented safari camp is set within a natural forest of ebony &amp; elephant pepper trees, overlooking the Mara plains in Kenya.
In season, this fantastic location becomes the vantage point for the spectacular annual migration of wildebeest &amp; zebra – a bucket list experience that should be on everyone’s list.
With its remote location in the Masai Mara - a World Heritage Site - guests can expect excellent year-round game viewing as well as frequent sightings of big cats, elephants &amp; large herds of plains game.

#### Stay
Elephant Pepper Camp has 8 safari tents &amp; 2 safari suites. (ideal for honeymooners or families) 
The tents are set underneath a grove of fig &amp; Elephant Pepper Trees &amp; are spaced out to ensure privacy.  Each tent has a spacious en-suite bathroom &amp; a private veranda with a hammock.
The 2 suites can be used for honeymooners or families looking for extra space &amp; privacy.  Each suite features an en-suite bathroom, sitting room (which can be converted into a second bedroom for children under the age of 16 years) &amp; a private veranda offering beautiful views over the savanna plains.
The main area comprises a mess tent with lounge &amp; dining area, a library &amp; campfire.

#### Activities
Daily open 4x4 game drives &amp; guided bush walks are offered at Elephant Pepper Camp.
Because the camp lies in a private conservancy, vehicle density is low – which means that guests not only have access to the greater Mara but also to exclusive areas within limited access for other vehicles.
The camp is unfenced (&amp; patrolled by Maasai guards), so often wildlife is found wandering in &amp; out of camp, making for thrilling wildlife encounters.
