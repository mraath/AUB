### Buhoma Lodge

#### Experience
Buhoma Lodge is situated at the gateway to Bwindi Impenetrable Forest &amp; is one of only 2 lodges set within the national park &amp; an ideal choice when embarking on your bucket-list gorilla trekking expedition. 
The lodge is renowned for its warm &amp; welcoming atmosphere &amp; little extras like a complimentary massage, a boot cleaning service &amp; a hot water bottle in bed make guests feel extra welcome.
Since Buhoma Lodge is located just steps away from the trek start point, gorillas have been spotted popping in for an occasional visit, while the resident monkeys tend to visit the gardens almost daily.

#### Stay
Buhoma Lodge consists of 10 eco-friendly spacious wooden chalets constructed using sustainable materials.  
Each chalet features an en-suite bathroom with a rain shower &amp; private veranda with sweeping views over the forest.  The central lodge area includes an elevated lounge, bar &amp; dining area &amp; crackling fireplace for cooler evenings.
