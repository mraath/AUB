## Bwindi Impenetrable National Park
### Bwindi Lodge

#### Experience
Bwindi Lodge is a luxurious eco-lodge set in the forest canopy of Ugandaâ€™s beautiful Bwindi Impenetrable National Park.
This area is renowned for its life-changing gorilla trekking expeditions.  The Buhoma region of Impenetrable Forest has at least 3 habituated gorilla families that live in the thick, damp tropical undergrowth.  Tracking them is exciting &amp; rewarding.  
The area is also home to monkeys, chimpanzees &amp; countless birds which does not make it hard to believe why this pocket of the primaeval forest is one of the most biologically diverse areas on Earth &amp; a World Heritage Site.

#### Stay
Bwindi Lodge comprises 8 luxury bandas &amp; 1 larger deluxe banda, all offering spectacular views of the forest.  Each banda is complete with an en-suite bathroom &amp; private terrace.
The central lodge area features a dining area, bar &amp; forest spa that offers a 30-minute complimentary massage per guest per day.

#### Activities
Activities at Bwindi Lodge are ample!  
Guests can track gorillas in the wild, enjoy nature walks to nearby waterfalls or rivers (&amp; take a swim in the rockpools) &amp; enjoy local tapas from the Bwindi Bar that are served in the wonderful garden overlooking the forest.
They can also go on a tea-picking tour where the locals will demonstrate how tea is grown, picked &amp; traditionally processed in Uganda.
