### Singita Kataza House

#### Experience
Singita Kataza House is an exclusive-use luxury private villa situated at the foot of the Volcanoes National Park &amp; is a haven for trekkers to unwind after coming face to face with Rwandaâ€™s mountain gorillas.
The villa is a blend between contemporary style &amp; African appeal, set against the backdrop of mountain bamboo, ferns &amp; forest trees.
Since the villa can only be booked on an exclusive-use basis, guests will enjoy the perks of having a personal chef, host, guide &amp; safari vehicle throughout their stay.  Discerning travellers can now experience life-changing gorilla encounters &amp; return to their villa after a day in the forest for a home-away-from-home feel.

#### Stay
While completely private, the villa is set alongside Singita Kwitonda Lodge.  Guests at Kataza House enjoy access to all facilities &amp; amenities at the lodge, which offers additional spaces for convivial relaxing, entertaining &amp; dining.
Singita Kataza House sleeps 8 people in 4 suites.  
Each suite enjoys uninterrupted views of the mountainous, forested national park &amp; features a cosy sitting area with fireplace, private dining space, en-suite bathroom with indoor shower &amp; glass-enclosed outdoor shower as well as a private terrace with fireplace &amp; heated plunge pool.
The villa comes complete with an interactive open-plan kitchen, open living-dining spaces, a cinema room, fitness centre, small wine cellar, larger heated pool &amp; smaller heated pool off the master bedroom, a massage treatment room as well as an on-site nursery &amp; farm-to-table garden.

#### Activities
Not only will guests be able to set off on an unforgettable gorilla-trekking expedition during their stay at Singita Kataza House, but they can also go on forest hikes to find the rare golden monkey or enjoy cooking classes &amp; wine tasting as well as book day trips to Kigali.
