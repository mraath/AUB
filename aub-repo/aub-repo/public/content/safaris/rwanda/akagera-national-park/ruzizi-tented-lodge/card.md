## Akagera National Park
### Ruzizi Tented Lodge

#### Experience
Akagera National Park is one of the best birding areas in the world &amp; it is here where Ruzizi Tented Lodge enjoys a spectacular waterside location on Lake Ihema.  
Ruzizi is one of only 3 lodges located within Akagera National Park, allowing guests to have an authentic, unspoiled wilderness experience.
Thanks to great conservation efforts, the park is – once again – home to the Big 5.  Akagera is a scenic drive from the capital city, Kigali, offering the perfect opportunity to see savannah animals after a gorilla- or chimp-trekking safari.

#### Stay
This intimate, eco-friendly retreat offers 7 standard tents as well as a superior treetop tent, which is ideal for either honeymooners or families.  
Each tent boasts an en-suite bathroom with a bathtub or outdoor shower as well as a tree-trunk table &amp; hammock on the shaded veranda.
The main area comprises a thatched reception &amp; dining room with wooden walkways leading to a stunning deck overlooking the lake.  The central fire pit is the perfect spot to enjoy a morning cup of coffee or pre-dinner drinks.

#### Activities
Ruzizi Tented Lodge offers a variety of exciting activities.  Some of these include boating trips, exhilarating game drives, night drives, guided walks, community visits as well as a unique “behind the scenes” tour of the park headquarters.
