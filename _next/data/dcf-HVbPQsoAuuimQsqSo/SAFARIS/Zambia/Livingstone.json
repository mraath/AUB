This extraordinary waterfall is not only listed as one of the 7 Natural Wonders of the World, but it also forms the largest curtain of water on the planet &amp;amp can be viewed from both Zambian &amp;amp Zimbabwean sides.<br>Livingstone offers guests the rare opportunity to swim at Devils’ Pool - the edge of the thundering Vic Falls – a bucket list experience that should be added to everyone’s list!<br>Accommodation in Livingstone is usually geared towards the discerning traveller who is looking for luxury accommodation in Zambia as a base from which to explore. A range of elegant lodges &amp;amp boutique hotels offers bed &amp;amp breakfast options while some also include activities over a 3-night stay.<br>Visitors to Livingstone can also walk across to the Zimbabwean side &amp;amp view the iconic Victoria Falls from both countries. (visa needed upon arrival)</p>\n<h4>Activities</h4>\n<p>Plenty of fun-filled activities are available in Zambia. These include helicopter flights over the Falls, swimming at Devils’ Pool, Livingstone island lunches, romantic sunset boat cruises, river rafting, canoeing &amp;amp exciting elephant interactions.<br>For anyone who longs to view The Victoria Falls from the air, a scenic helicopter or microlight flight is usually a highlight!</p>\n<h4>When to travel</h4>\n<p>The best time to visit the spectacular Victoria Falls is during ‘High Water’ season - from February to July, directly after the region&#39;s summer rains, when you&#39;ll see the world&#39;s largest sheet of falling water flowing at its greatest volume.<br>‘Low Water’ runs between August &amp;amp January &amp;amp is at its lowest between November &amp;amp early December. This is the time when there is very little spray &amp;amp visitors can fully appreciate the geological formation of Victoria Falls &amp;amp the full length &amp;amp breadth of them. River rafting &amp;amp swimming at Devi’s Pool are wonderful activities to experience during low season.</p>\n","images":["optimized-images/SAFARIS/Zambia/Livingstone/1Livingstone-large.webp","optimized-images/SAFARIS/Zambia/Livingstone/2Livingstone-large.webp","optimized-images/SAFARIS/Zambia/Livingstone/3Livingstone-large.webp","optimized-images/SAFARIS/Zambia/Livingstone/4Livingstone-large.webp","optimized-images/SAFARIS/Zambia/Livingstone/5Livingstone-large.webp","optimized-images/SAFARIS/Zambia/Livingstone/6Livingstone-large.webp","optimized-images/SAFARIS/Zambia/Livingstone/7Livingstone-large.webp","optimized-images/SAFARIS/Zambia/Livingstone/8Livingstone-large.webp"],"subfolders":[{"title":"David Livingstone Lodge","description":"David Livingstone Lodge &amp; Spa is centrally located only 5km from the town of Livingstone in Zambia &amp; offers a unique location with breathtaking views.
