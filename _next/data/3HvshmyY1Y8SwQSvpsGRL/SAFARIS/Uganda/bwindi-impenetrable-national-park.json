Out of these, several families have become habituated to humans, allowing intimate groups of trekkers to spend an hour in their company under the supervision of expert guides.<br>Set against the slopes of a mountain range, the forest offers a wealth of biodiversity, including forest elephants, giant forest hogs &amp;amp hundreds of butterflies. Several types of primates also roam beneath the thick canopy of trees.<br>Over &amp;amp above gorilla trekking safaris, Bwindi also offers guests the rare opportunity to be part of the Gorilla Habituation Experience – the slow &amp;amp gentle introduction of a family of wild gorillas to the presence of humans. This means that trekkers can have more time with the gorillas while contributing to conservation.</p>\n<h4>Activities</h4>\n<p>Apart from trekking endangered mountain gorillas in Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, other exciting activities are also offered, including hiking, bird watching &amp;amp meeting the local Batwa people – an interesting cultural experience.</p>\n<h4>When to travel</h4>\n<p>Bwindi is open for gorilla trekking all year long, but the best times to go are from June to September &amp;amp December to February. At these times, the forest trails are drier &amp;amp therefore less slippery. Also, your chance of a dry gorilla viewing experience is higher during these months.<br>Gorilla treks can be physically challenging, especially during Uganda’s rainy seasons, which are from March to May &amp;amp then again in October &amp;amp November.<br>Depending on the gorilla’s last location, the trek can take anywhere between 40 minutes to 6 hours, after which guests will be able to spend time with the gorillas for 1 hour.</p>\n","images":["optimized-images/SAFARIS/Uganda/bwindi-impenetrable-national-park/1Bwindi-large.webp","optimized-images/SAFARIS/Uganda/bwindi-impenetrable-national-park/2Bwindi-large.webp","optimized-images/SAFARIS/Uganda/bwindi-impenetrable-national-park/3Bwindi-large.webp","optimized-images/SAFARIS/Uganda/bwindi-impenetrable-national-park/4Bwindi-large.webp","optimized-images/SAFARIS/Uganda/bwindi-impenetrable-national-park/5Bwindi-large.webp","optimized-images/SAFARIS/Uganda/bwindi-impenetrable-national-park/6Bwindi-large.webp","optimized-images/SAFARIS/Uganda/bwindi-impenetrable-national-park/7Bwindi-large.webp","optimized-images/SAFARIS/Uganda/bwindi-impenetrable-national-park/8Bwindi-large.webp"],"subfolders":[{"title":"Buhoma Lodge","description":"Buhoma Lodge is situated at the gateway to Bwindi Impenetrable Forest &amp; is one of only 2 lodges set within the national park &amp; an ideal choice when embarking on your bucket-list gorilla trekking expedition.
