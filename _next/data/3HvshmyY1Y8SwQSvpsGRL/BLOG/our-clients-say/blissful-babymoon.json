Where do I begin?? We loved all the camps.  Our favourite was probably Nottens, but our favourite location was Moremi.  The scenery and animals there were just so beautiful!

Everything went smoothly &amp; according to plan &amp; we really enjoyed our stay at the three safari camps – Splash Camp in the Okavango Delta, Lebala Camp in the Linyanti &amp; The Elephant Camp at Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe.","image":"optimized-images/BLOG/our-clients-say/botswana-magic/1-Botswana-Magic-small.webp","folderName":"blog/our-clients-say/botswana-magic"},{"title":"Garden Route Getaway","description":"Liselle was amazing in structuring our holiday package! Along with the accommodation booking, she offered us a range of recommended activities in the area. All of which were great!  We appreciated the attention to detail, it removed all the guess work & uncertainty from the trip, ensuring that we relaxed and enjoyed the itinerary. We’ll definitely make use of Africa Unwind in the future!","image":"optimized-images/BLOG/our-clients-say/garden-route-getaway/1-Garden-Route-Getaway-small.webp","folderName":"blog/our-clients-say/garden-route-getaway"},{"title":"Honeymoon In Style","description":"We really appreciate all of Liselle’s support during our travels – she was extremely prompt in her response times &amp; we felt that she was always accessible, especially when we urgently needed her (after a natural disaster forced us to change lodges). In speaking with and comparing experiences with other travelers who were using some of the larger companies, we felt that we received a personalized &amp; top service from her. From the moment our itinerary was arranged to how she assisted us in finding substitute accommodations so quickly after a natural disaster. We were truly blown away by Lion Sands Ivory Lodge and also recognize that we likely received such a generous upgrade because of her local relationships.

Arathusa Safari Lodge was brilliant - especially with the waterhole full! We saw wild dogs, leopards & a cub as well as many lions & plenty of other wildlife.
