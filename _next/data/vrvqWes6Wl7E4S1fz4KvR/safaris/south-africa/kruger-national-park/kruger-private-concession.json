Vegetation thins during this time, so wildlife spotting is easy.<br>April &amp; October are considered shoulder months &amp; are also good for game viewing.  During the rainy season, December to March – the bush is lush &amp; it turns into a birder’s paradise.</p>\n","images":["optimized-images/safaris/south-africa/kruger-national-park/kruger-private-concession/1krugerconcession-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/south-africa/kruger-national-park/kruger-private-concession/2krugerconcession-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/south-africa/kruger-national-park/kruger-private-concession/3krugerconcession-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/south-africa/kruger-national-park/kruger-private-concession/4krugerconcession-1-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/south-africa/kruger-national-park/kruger-private-concession/5krugerconcession-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/south-africa/kruger-national-park/kruger-private-concession/6krugerconcession-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/south-africa/kruger-national-park/kruger-private-concession/7krugerconcession-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/south-africa/kruger-national-park/kruger-private-concession/8krugerconcession-large.webp"],"subfolders":[{"title":"Hamiltons Tented Camp","description":"Situated within a private concession in the world-renowned Kruger National Park, Hamiltons Tented Camp takes you back to an era where grace &amp; style were the epitome of luxurious living.
