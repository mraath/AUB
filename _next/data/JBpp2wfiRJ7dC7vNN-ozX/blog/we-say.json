It all depends on one crucial holiday ingredient:  activities! “What are we going to do today?” is often the one question parents hear while on holiday - &amp; often repetitively. So, I made it my mission to find a holiday that offers of a bagful of fun for the whole family – including Mum &amp; Dad. OK, Let’s be honest – traveling with kids can be fun (or not).

Safari outfits?  Check.  Camera?  Check.  Swim gear?  Check.  After I have packed these three essentials, I almost felt like the rest of the things on my list were suddenly not so important anymore.

So I did.)","image":"optimized-images/blog/we-say/sunny-safari/1SunnySafari-small.webp","folderName":"blog/we-say/sunny-safari"},{"title":"Wine & Whales","description":"Apart from seeing the Big 5 on safari, there are 2 things that get most travellers excited:  Wine &amp; Whales – in no particular order!
