This article is finished.</p>\n<p>The only reason I continue to write, is because there is so much to say about South Africa’s most beautiful city.  You may think I am biased since I was born here &amp; grew up here – but then I meet people from other countries around the world who agree with me - &amp; I realise, I am right! (She said humbly.)<br>This is why my family &amp; I often pretend we are tourists in our own city.  We go to the beach, we visit the penguins at Boulders Beach, we hike to the top of Table Mountain (or on lazy days – we take the cable car) &amp; each time, we realise how fortunate we are to call this place home.<br>South Africa’s oldest city – hence the nickname “the Mother City” offers something for everyone!  Gorgeous white-sand beaches, spectacular mountains &amp; lush green vineyards are right on your doorstep.  And of course, there are a variety of boutique shops, museums, galleries &amp; world-class restaurants to choose from.<br>What makes Cape Town so unique, is that couples, honeymooners &amp; families all want to visit.<br>One of my family’s favourite activities in Cape Town, is taking a drive to Cape Point, along the scenic Atlantic Seaboard.  On our way, we normally stop at the affluent coastal suburbs of Camps Bay, Clifton &amp; Llandudno that lie below the Twelve Apostles Mountain range.  Nothing gets me more excited than spending time at the beach – especially in summer!<br>Our next stop is normally Hout Bay, a quaint seaside village with magnificent views. And then we proceed onto Chapmans’ Peak Drive – one of the world’s most spectacular coastal drives towards the Cape of Good Hope Nature Reserve &amp; Cape Point.<br>With towering stone cliffs, endemic fynbos, breathtaking bays &amp; rolling green hills, Cape Point is a must on your Cape Town holiday itinerary!  This is usually where I take out my camera &amp; force my family to pose for a million photos!  (One day, they will treasure these memories.)<br>When my camera battery has died &amp; the kids are ready for food &amp; ice cream, we make our way to Simons Town for lunch &amp; always stop at Boulders Beach with its adorable penguin colony.  Yes, the rumours are true – when visiting this gorgeous beach with turquoise blue water &amp; white sand, you’ll be surrounded by furry little friends in their natural habitat.  Watch the African penguins swim, dive &amp; wobble around the beach while you relax in the sun (or in my husband’s case – the shade).<br>After our stomachs (&amp; hearts) are full, we normally end the day with a visit to Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens.  Set against the slopes of Table Mountain, the gardens are known around the world for its beauty &amp; diversity of the Cape Flora it displays.<br>Whether you are exploring Cape Town at your own pace or booked a private guided tour with Africa Unwind, you will be blown away by The Mother City.<br>The sun is starting to set &amp; we have enjoyed pretending to be tourists in our own city.  It is time to go home, but no one wants to leave…<br>The four of us agree.  We won’t.</p>\n","images":["optimized-images/blog/we-say/mother-city/1MotherCity-large.webp","optimized-images/blog/we-say/mother-city/2MotherCity-large.webp","optimized-images/blog/we-say/mother-city/3MotherCity-large.webp","optimized-images/blog/we-say/mother-city/4MotherCity-large.webp","optimized-images/blog/we-say/mother-city/5MotherCity-large.webp","optimized-images/blog/we-say/mother-city/6MotherCity-large.webp","optimized-images/blog/we-say/mother-city/7MotherCity-large.webp","optimized-images/blog/we-say/mother-city/8MotherCity-large.webp"],"subfolders":[{"title":"Family Fun","description":"OK, Let’s be honest – traveling with kids can be fun (or not).
