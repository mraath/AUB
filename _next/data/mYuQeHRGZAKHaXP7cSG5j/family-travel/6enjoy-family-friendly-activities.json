They are simply not child-friendly.<br>Fortunately, Africa is the ‘Fun Aunt’ when it comes to family-friendly activities, so rest assured: Mum, Dad &amp; the little ones will have a blast!<br>Africa offers you the chance to spot a lion in the wild, ride on the back of an elephant, zipline through a forest, quad bike in the desert &amp; go on treasure hunt adventures.  If you can think of it, you’ll probably be able to do it:  helicopter flights, hot air balloon safaris, sunset boat cruises, snorkelling, stand-up paddleboarding, scuba diving, canoe safaris, guided walks, stargazing….the list is endless.  There is also bungee jumping, animal encounters, treehouse sleep-outs &amp; Kids Clubs.<br>Since each lodge, camp or resort offers its own list of exciting activities, why not browse through a few of them &amp; see for yourself?  Or – even better – ask one of our African Safari Experts to help you plan your dream holiday.  That’s why we are here!<br>We are happy to custom design a holiday that will suit your family’s needs &amp; requirements, so send us an enquiry &amp; we’ll get back to you with some exciting suggestions.<br>Whatever your family wants to do, we can probably make it happen!<br>Because it is challenging to put together a list of all the activities Africa has to offer, we thought we’ll direct you to the very beginning.<br>What kind of holiday will be ideal for your family?  A safari?  An island getaway?  Or a city break? (Or all of the above?)</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Safaris<br>Perhaps everyone on Planet Earth has dreamed of going on safari to Africa!  The word safari means “journey” &amp; visiting the real Africa is a unique experience.  Getting up close &amp; personal with some of the world’s most impressive &amp; endangered animals, sleeping in luxury tents &amp; learning more about the fascinating African culture is what a safari holiday is all about!</li>\n<li>Islands<br>Life is busy.  So, let’s be honest – all of us deserve some pampering every now &amp; again.  For some – pampering means strolling on white, sandy beaches with crystal clear water, while others enjoy eating fresh seafood or sipping on a cocktail while watching the sunset.  There are those who prefer lying in a hammock or getting a relaxing massage while others want to dive, snorkel &amp; explore the island through adventure activities.  Whichever way you choose to relax, an island will get you there!</li>\n<li>Cities<br>While many people love to get away from the hustle &amp; bustle of city life while on holiday, they often realize that visiting a city in another part of the world can be just as relaxing as a safari or a beach holiday.  You don’t have to worry about meals, because everything is available around the clock – from high-end restaurants &amp; cafes to cocktail bars &amp; markets.  Besides, you get to explore, see new places, experience new cultures, indulge in adventure activities &amp; also tick off your bucket list.</li>\n</ol>\n","images":["optimized-images/family-travel/6enjoy-family-friendly-activities/1EnjoyFamily-FriendlyActivities-large.webp","optimized-images/family-travel/6enjoy-family-friendly-activities/2EnjoyFamily-FriendlyActivities-large.webp","optimized-images/family-travel/6enjoy-family-friendly-activities/3EnjoyFamily-FriendlyActivities-large.webp","optimized-images/family-travel/6enjoy-family-friendly-activities/4EnjoyFamily-FriendlyActivities-large.webp","optimized-images/family-travel/6enjoy-family-friendly-activities/5EnjoyFamily-FriendlyActivities-large.webp","optimized-images/family-travel/6enjoy-family-friendly-activities/6EnjoyFamily-FriendlyActivities-large.webp","optimized-images/family-travel/6enjoy-family-friendly-activities/7EnjoyFamily-FriendlyActivities-large.webp","optimized-images/family-travel/6enjoy-family-friendly-activities/8EnjoyFamily-FriendlyActivities-large.webp"],"subfolders":[{"title":"1Witness Fascinating Animal Encounters","description":"WITNESS FASCINATING ANIMAL ENCOUNTERS All children love animals, &amp; in Africa – there is a lot of love going around!
