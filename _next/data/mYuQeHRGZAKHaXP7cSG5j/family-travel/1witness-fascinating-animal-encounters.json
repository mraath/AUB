Of course, the very first thing you should do is go on safari…But your family should also experience one of our favourite child-friendly activities: ‘Meet the Animals of Africa!’<br>Ready for some fun &amp; excitement?  Here we go…</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Enjoy Elephant Encounters:  Abu Camp, Okavango Delta - Botswana<br>The elephant is one of Africa’s most iconic animals &amp; stand out from all other species while on safari.  Quite literally!  Not only do they have an impressive size, but always manage to find a way into people’s hearts.  There are many places in Africa where you can enjoy life-changing elephant interactions (with an emphasis on rescuing, rehabilitation &amp; releasing), but our favourite is Abu Camp in Botswana’s Okavango Delta.  Here, you can touch them, feed them, walk with them &amp; even sleep in the iconic Elephant Star Bed above their boma where you will be serenaded to sleep by the contented rumblings of the elephants below.  We’ll also recommend The Elephant Camp in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe &amp; Elephant Whispers or The Elephant Sanctuary in South Africa.</li>\n<li>Meet the Penguins:  Boulders Beach, Cape Town – South Africa<br>When families travel to Cape Town, one of the first stops on the itinerary is Boulders Beach!  Not only is Boulders one of Cape Town’s most beautiful beaches, but it is the only place in the world where you can get close to African penguins.  Yes, that’s right – here they waddle past you as you bask in the sun or enjoy a leisurely picnic.  This family-friendly swimming beach is the perfect place for your family to relax.  The kids can climb over boulders, explore the rock pools, or swim in the cool, clear False Bay water.  </li>\n<li>Eat breakfast with giraffes:  Giraffe Manor, Nairobi - Kenya<br>Giraffe Manor is known to offer “the most unforgettable bucket list breakfast in the world.”  This exclusive boutique hotel is set on private land in an indigenous forest in Nairobi, Kenya - &amp; is the ideal stop-over before or after an East African Safari.  One of the biggest drawcards is the resident herd of Rothchild’s giraffes who may visit morning &amp; evening, poking their long necks into the windows in the hope of a treat.  You can take pictures as they ‘interrupt’ your breakfast &amp; enjoy the laughs &amp; giggles from your little ones as they feed them.</li>\n<li>Interact with Meerkats:  Makgadikgadi Pans - Botswana<br>These small, desert-adapted mammals are found throughout the Kalahari, which covers much of Botswana.  But the best place to interact with them is in the Makgadikgadi Pans in Botswana.  We recommend staying at San Camp, Jacks’ Camp or Camp Kalahari as they offer a meerkat experience with habituated families.  Meerkats are not shy &amp; it is not uncommon for them to jump on you as you sit still, seeking a high location from which to guard.  Children love these little creatures, so get ready to take some amazing family photographs!</li>\n<li>Watch baby turtles nest:  Thonga Beach Lodge, Maputaland Coastal Reserve – South Africa<br>The Maputaland Coast in South Africa’s KwaZulu-Natal is the only remaining major nesting site in Africa where Loggerhead and Leatherback turtles still lay their eggs.  Each year, between November &amp; February your family can go turtle tracking &amp; witness these great creatures of the deep haul themselves out of the ocean to lay eggs on the shore.</li>\n<li>Witness whales calve:  Hermanus, Whale Route – South Africa<br>Famous for its majestic nature &amp; impressive size, the Southern Right Whale has always been a fascination for many.  And only a 2-hour drive from the vibrant city of Cape Town in a coastal town called Hermanus, you can witness the best land-based whale watching in the world!  Each year between July &amp; November, whale-lovers arrive along the coast to witness these massive mammals give birth &amp; care for their newborn calves.  Fun for the entire family?  For sure!</li>\n</ol>\n","images":["optimized-images/family-travel/1witness-fascinating-animal-encounters/1WitnessFascinatingAnimalEncounters-large.webp","optimized-images/family-travel/1witness-fascinating-animal-encounters/2WitnessFascinatingAnimalEncounters-large.webp","optimized-images/family-travel/1witness-fascinating-animal-encounters/3WitnessFascinatingAnimalEncounters-large.webp","optimized-images/family-travel/1witness-fascinating-animal-encounters/4WitnessFascinationAnimalEncounters-large.webp","optimized-images/family-travel/1witness-fascinating-animal-encounters/5WitnessFascinatingAnimalEncounters-large.webp","optimized-images/family-travel/1witness-fascinating-animal-encounters/6WitnessFascinatingAnimalEncounters-large.webp","optimized-images/family-travel/1witness-fascinating-animal-encounters/7WitnessFascinatingAnimalEncounters-large.webp","optimized-images/family-travel/1witness-fascinating-animal-encounters/8WitnessFascinatingAnimalEncounters-large.webp"],"subfolders":[{"title":"1Witness Fascinating Animal Encounters","description":"WITNESS FASCINATING ANIMAL ENCOUNTERS All children love animals, &amp; in Africa – there is a lot of love going around!
