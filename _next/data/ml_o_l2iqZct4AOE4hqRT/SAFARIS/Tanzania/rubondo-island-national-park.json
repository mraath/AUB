Rubondo Island National Park, however, is a captivating exception, drawing travelers to its forested shores. Here, you&#39;ll encounter a diverse array of large game, including chimpanzees, elephants, &amp;amp giraffes, along with an impressive birdlife featuring around 400 species.</p>\n<h4>Activities</h4>\n<p>Rubondo Island National Park invites nature enthusiasts to embrace the tranquility of lakeside living while partaking in various forest activities. Options include exhilarating chimpanzee trekking safaris, game drives, &amp;amp leisurely forest walks that focus on smaller creatures &amp;amp avian wonders. For those seeking angling adventures, catch-and-release fishing on Lake Victoria is an enticing option. Don&#39;t miss the thrill of overnight fly-camping expeditions for the more adventurous traveler.</p>\n<h4>When to travel</h4>\n<p>The optimal time to visit Rubondo Island National Park is during the cooler, dry season spanning from June to October.
