Where do I begin?? We loved all the camps.  Our favourite was probably Nottens, but our favourite location was Moremi.  The scenery and animals there were just so beautiful!  Each camp had something special and unique to offer.

Her recommendation did not disappoint.  We had an absolute blast at Cederberg Ridge Wilderness Lodge, being treated as royalty from the moment we arrived.  We had the peacefulness of a fireplace in our suite and sipping on local tea from the area.

Along with the accommodation booking, she offered us a range of recommended activities in the area. All of which were great!  We appreciated the attention to detail, it removed all the guess work & uncertainty from the trip, ensuring that we relaxed and enjoyed the itinerary. We’ll definitely make use of Africa Unwind in the future!","image":"optimized-images/blog/our-clients-say/garden-route-getaway/1-Garden-Route-Getaway-small.webp","folderName":"blog/our-clients-say/garden-route-getaway"},{"title":"Honeymoon In Style","description":"We really appreciate all of Liselle’s support during our travels – she was extremely prompt in her response times &amp; we felt that she was always accessible, especially when we urgently needed her (after a natural disaster forced us to change lodges). In speaking with and comparing experiences with other travelers who were using some of the larger companies, we felt that we received a personalized &amp; top service from her. From the moment our itinerary was arranged to how she assisted us in finding substitute accommodations so quickly after a natural disaster. We were truly blown away by Lion Sands Ivory Lodge and also recognize that we likely received such a generous upgrade because of her local relationships.

Arathusa Safari Lodge was brilliant - especially with the waterhole full! We saw wild dogs, leopards & a cub as well as many lions & plenty of other wildlife.  The staff were brilliant & we will all certainly go back. Our stay in Camps Bay was also fantastic!","image":"optimized-images/blog/our-clients-say/sabi-sand-safari/1-Sabi-Sand-Safari-small.webp","folderName":"blog/our-clients-say/sabi-sand-safari"}],"parentCards":[{"title":"All Things Africa","image":"optimized-images/blog/all-things-africa/1-all-things-africa-small.webp","folderName":"blog/all-things-africa","isCurrentFolder":false},{"title":"Our Clients Say","image":"optimized-images/blog/our-clients-say/1-clients-say-small.webp","folderName":"blog/our-clients-say","isCurrentFolder":true},{"title":"We Say","image":"optimized-images/blog/we-say/1-we-say-small.webp","folderName":"blog/we-say","isCurrentFolder":false}],"h1Title":"Botswana Magic","h2Title":"Our Clients Say","h3Title":"Botswana Magic","whatWeLoveItems":[],"params":{"slug":["blog","our-clients-say","botswana-magic"]},"level":3},"__N_SSG":true}
