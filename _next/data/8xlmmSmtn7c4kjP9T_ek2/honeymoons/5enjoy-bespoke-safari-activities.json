The holidays we design are made especially for you because we are passionate about taking all your holiday needs &amp; requirements into consideration.<br>When it comes to a honeymoon, there is nothing more frustrating than spending most of your time with others, in large groups or stuck to a certain schedule – rather than enjoying the privacy you so deserve!<br>We’ll make sure that your honeymoon activities are tailored to perfection so that you can spend all your time focussing on the one you love.<br>Here is a list of our favourite bespoke honeymoon activities that can all be enjoyed on your own &amp; at your desired pace &amp; time.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Private Day Tours, Cape Town - South Africa<br>Cape Town is usually high up on the list when it comes to honeymoons.  There is so much to see &amp; do in &amp; around this vibrant city – from the iconic Table Mountain &amp; Boulders Beach with its adorable penguins to wining &amp; dining in the Wine Route &amp; getting pampered at a world-class spa.  Instead of booking a scheduled tour, we’ll recommend private day tours – which means that you will have a dedicated driver, guide &amp; air-conditioned vehicle &amp; can explore the city at your own pace.</li>\n<li>Exclusive Safari Drives - Safaris<br>Most lodges in Africa have a maximum policy of 10 guests per safari vehicle, but when you are on honeymoon &amp; require a little more privacy, exclusive use of a vehicle is high on the list.  When you have a private ranger, tracker &amp; vehicle, you can come &amp; go as you wish &amp; spend more time at a great sighting.  Of course, it does come at an additional cost, but if privacy is truly what you are after – it is worth every cent.</li>\n<li>Private Candle-lit Dinners – Islands<br>Romantic dinners are all about atmosphere &amp; location.  When you are on honeymoon, we inform the lodges &amp; resorts that you are celebrating a special occasion, so that they can go the extra mile for you.  Usually, this means a special dinner in a beautiful location – be that on your private deck while on safari, or the beach next to the ocean.  Our top pick is a candle-lit dinner on a tropical island – pretty romantic, isn’t it?</li>\n<li>Couple’s Massages – Wine Route<br>What is more relaxing than sharing a couple’s massage with your loved one? Africa has a long list of wellness spas that will tick all the boxes when it comes to pampering.  Many safari lodges offer tranquil massages next to a waterhole, on your private deck or at the spa while most island resorts boast world-class spas overlooking the ocean.  Some of our favourite spas can be found in Cape Town &amp; the Wine Route, so make sure to add a spa day to your honeymoon itinerary.</li>\n<li>The Bubble Bath Experience, Kruger National Park – South Africa<br>For sheer indulgence, enjoy a romantic bubble bath in the comfort of your room or tent.  Picture this:  a sunken bath set on a secluded platform in the heart of the bushveld, as you relax by candlelight while enjoying a chilled glass of wine.  Some of our favourite bathtubs can be found in the Kruger’s Private Reserve in South Africa.  You’re on honeymoon, so leave it to us – we’ll arrange a romantic turn-down &amp; Bubble Bath Experience for you.</li>\n</ol>\n","images":["optimized-images/honeymoons/5enjoy-bespoke-safari-activities/1enjoybespokesafariactivities-large.webp","optimized-images/honeymoons/5enjoy-bespoke-safari-activities/2enjoybespokesafariactivities-large.webp","optimized-images/honeymoons/5enjoy-bespoke-safari-activities/3enjoybespokesafariactivities-large.webp","optimized-images/honeymoons/5enjoy-bespoke-safari-activities/4enjoybespokesafariactivities-large.webp","optimized-images/honeymoons/5enjoy-bespoke-safari-activities/5enjoybespokesafariactivities-large.webp","optimized-images/honeymoons/5enjoy-bespoke-safari-activities/6enjoybespokesafariactivities-large.webp","optimized-images/honeymoons/5enjoy-bespoke-safari-activities/7enjoybespokesafariactivities-large.webp","optimized-images/honeymoons/5enjoy-bespoke-safari-activities/8enjoybespokesafariactivities-large.webp"],"subfolders":[{"title":"CAPE TOWN","description":"Nestled between the Indian & Atlantic Oceans with iconic Table Mountain as backdrop, lies one of the world’s most vibrant &amp; breathtaking cities.
