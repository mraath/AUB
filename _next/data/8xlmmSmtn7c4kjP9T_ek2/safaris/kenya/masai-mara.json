It&#39;s when the Mara becomes a vital pit stop for the endless masses of wildebeests, zebras, &amp;amp gazelles embarking on their death-defying, 2,900-kilometer circular journey following the rains.<br>But before these resilient herds can reach the Mara&#39;s lush grazing grounds from Tanzania&#39;s Serengeti National Park, they must confront the dramatic, crocodile-infested rivers—a sight to behold in its own right.<br>For those seeking close encounters with Africa&#39;s predators and big game, staying in a private conservancy that permits off-road driving &amp;amp night drives is essential.</p>\n<h4>Activities</h4>\n<p>The heart of the Masai Mara experience lies in open 4x4 game drives &amp;amp walking safaris guided by Maasai warriors. These game drives take you right into the heart of the action, ensuring intimate encounters with Africa&#39;s wildlife. Expert local guides lead both morning &amp;amp afternoon game drives.<br>Some lodges also offer night drives with spotlights, allowing you to focus on elusive nocturnal animals. Another highlight is exploring the bush from a bird&#39;s-eye view in a hot air balloon. After the flight, you&#39;ll enjoy a champagne breakfast—an ideal start to a morning in the Mara.</p>\n<h4>When to travel</h4>\n<p>The Masai Mara offers superb year-round wildlife viewing, so there&#39;s no single &#39;best time to go&#39; for general game viewing. High season (June to October) brings cooler, drier weather &amp;amp more crowds, while low season (November to March) offers warmer, wetter conditions &amp;amp fewer visitors. During the low season, there are more baby animals to see, &amp;amp birding is excellent.<br>However, the absolute best time to witness the world-famous Wildebeest Migration is usually between August &amp;amp November, depending on rainfall patterns. The Mara&#39;s resident animals give birth between December &amp;amp January during calving season.<br>MIGRATION EXPLAINED<br>JANUARY<br>In January, the herds move south from the northeast region to the area near Lake Ndutu.<br>FEBRUARY &amp;amp MARCH<br>February to March is calving season when over 8,000 wildebeest babies are born each day, offering the chance to witness the bittersweet interaction between fierce predators &amp;amp wobbly calves.<br>APRIL &amp;amp MAY<br>Between April &amp;amp May, the herds generally move northwest towards the Moru &amp;amp Simba Kopjes. Breeding is now in full swing, &amp;amp by May, the calves are stronger, allowing the herds to move a bit quicker into the central Serengeti.<br>JUNE<br>In June, they are typically in the central Serengeti, preparing for the most challenging part of their journey. Some herds may have split up, with a few already crossing the Grumeti River.<br>JULY<br>July sees them reach the Grumeti region and northern parts of the Serengeti, facing their greatest obstacle yet: the crocodile-infested waters of the Mara River.<br>AUGUST<br>August is usually the best time to witness the river crossings from the northern Serengeti to the Masai Mara.<br>SEPTEMBER<br>In September, the herds break into smaller groups, with most crossing over to the Masai Mara, while some (less than half) remain in the northern Serengeti.<br>OCTOBER<br>In October, the best chance to see them is still in the Masai Mara. Opt to stay in one of the less-crowded private conservancies that permit off-road driving &amp;amp night drives.<br>NOVEMBER<br>Typically, the short rains begin in November, tempting the wildebeests to leave the dry Mara for the rejuvenated Serengeti. You can usually spot them in the Serengeti&#39;s northeastern region, where they may split into smaller groups before continuing their southward journey.<br>DECEMBER<br>In December, the herds move south toward fresh grazing, covering the northern &amp;amp eastern Serengeti in preparation for another action-packed 3,000-kilometre journey.<br>Explore the magic of the Masai Mara &amp;amp witness nature&#39;s grand spectacle.</p>\n","images":["optimized-images/safaris/kenya/masai-mara/1masaimara-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/kenya/masai-mara/2masaimara-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/kenya/masai-mara/3masaimara-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/kenya/masai-mara/4masaimara-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/kenya/masai-mara/5masaimara-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/kenya/masai-mara/6masaimara-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/kenya/masai-mara/7masaimara-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/kenya/masai-mara/8masaimara-large.webp"],"subfolders":[{"title":"Angama Mara","description":"Angama Mara has it all – a spectacular setting, glorious views &amp; luxurious interiors.
