This buzzing city is famous for its friendly people &amp; warm hospitality.<br>Most people visit Rwanda to go on a once-in-a-lifetime gorilla-trekking safari, &amp; since Kigali enjoys a convenient location close to Volcanoes National Park, it offers guests the ideal pit stop before or after a gorilla-trekking adventure.<br>The city provides a choice of accommodation choices, from large hotels to smaller boutique-style bed &amp; breakfasts.</p>\n<h4>Activities</h4>\n<p>Visitors to Kigali can visit a variety of city attractions, such as the Genocide Memorial &amp; the Inema or Ivuka Art Centres &amp; even go shopping at the buzzing Kimironko market (arguably one of the best things to do in Kigali).<br>Day trips to Volcanoes National Park, Lake Kivu &amp; Akagera National Park are some of the nearby Kigali top attractions.</p>\n<h4>When to travel</h4>\n<p>Although Kigali is located within the heart of Rwanda, it has a temperate climate with a good amount of rainfall, thanks to its high elevation. Temperatures may vary slightly based on the seasonal months.<br>Year-round temperatures in Kigali range from daytime highs between 25C and 27C (77F to 81F), &amp; evening lows of 14C to 16C (57F to 61F). April through June are the coolest months, while visitors who opt to travel between June, July, August &amp; September are likely to experience warmer, drier weather in Kigali thus the best time to visit the city.<br>Like the rest of the cities in East Africa, Kigali also has two wet seasons: the long rains &amp; short rains. The long rains extend from March through May, with some showers possible even in January &amp; February. The months of October to November experience the short rains, with December generally having a bit of rain as well.<br>It does not rain continuously throughout the day during the wet seasons, &amp; there are times in Kigali when the sun is out. The hilly areas of Kigali &amp; the countryside have a cooler climate with slight variations compared to the flatter lower altitude regions.</p>\n","images":["optimized-images/CITIES/Kigali/1Kigali-large.webp","optimized-images/CITIES/Kigali/2Kigali-large.webp","optimized-images/CITIES/Kigali/3Kigali-large.webp","optimized-images/CITIES/Kigali/4Kigali-large.webp","optimized-images/CITIES/Kigali/5Kigali-large.webp","optimized-images/CITIES/Kigali/6Kigali-large.webp","optimized-images/CITIES/Kigali/7Kigali-large.webp","optimized-images/CITIES/Kigali/8Kigali-large.webp"],"subfolders":[{"title":"Kigali Marriott","description":"Kigali Marriott Hotel is located within downtown Kigali, close to the financial district &amp; Kigali City Hall.
