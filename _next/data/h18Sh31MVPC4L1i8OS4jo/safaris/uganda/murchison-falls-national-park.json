Therefore, guests can tick off predators &amp;amp primates in one holiday while enjoying both land &amp;amp water-based activities, including Murchison Falls boat safaris.<br>The park is home to the Victoria Nile – a river that divides the park into northern &amp;amp southern halves – that gives rise to its greatest drawcard, the Murchison Falls. Tumbling along a rocky canyon, the river is squeezed through a 7-metre wide fissure to create a magnificent waterfall – the focal point for boating safaris, including Murchison Falls boat safaris.<br>A variety of wildlife is found at Murchison Falls National Park. Here guests can see lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo, spotted hyena, cheetah, giraffe, hippo &amp;amp crocodile – plus an astounding bird list of over 500 species.<br>It is easy to combine a Murchison Falls safari with a gorilla trekking expedition to experience the best of both worlds, so make sure to include Bwindi Impenetrable Forest in your Uganda itinerary.</p>\n<h4>Activities</h4>\n<p>Both land &amp;amp water-based safari activities are offered at Murchison Falls National Park. These include open 4x4 game drives, walking safaris, boat cruises, fishing, bird watching &amp;amp cultural village visits.<br>Apart from experiencing the classic savanna-type safari, visitors to the park can also go on exciting chimpanzee trekking safaris at the nearby Budongo Forest Reserve where a variety of primates can be seen, including chimpanzees, baboons &amp;amp colobus monkeys.</p>\n<h4>When to travel</h4>\n<p>Watching wildlife in Murchison Falls National Park is generally good &amp;amp at its best during the dry season, from December to February. During this time, the grass is low, so it is easier to spot the animals. June to November is wet season, but the scenery is more beautiful during this time &amp;amp birdlife is fantastic.</p>\n","images":["optimized-images/safaris/uganda/murchison-falls-national-park/1murchisonfalls-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/uganda/murchison-falls-national-park/2murchisonfalls-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/uganda/murchison-falls-national-park/3murchisonfalls-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/uganda/murchison-falls-national-park/4murchisonfalls-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/uganda/murchison-falls-national-park/5murchisonfalls-1-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/uganda/murchison-falls-national-park/6murchisonfalls-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/uganda/murchison-falls-national-park/7murchisonfalls-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/uganda/murchison-falls-national-park/8murchisonfalls-large.webp"],"subfolders":[{"title":"Baker's Lodge","description":"Baker’s Lodge enjoys a beautiful location on the southern bank of the mighty Nile River in Murchison National Park – Uganda’s largest national park, &amp; together with adjoining wildlife reserves forms a vast wilderness covering 5,000 square km.
