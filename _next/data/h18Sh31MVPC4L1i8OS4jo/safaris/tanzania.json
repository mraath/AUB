Almost everywhere you look, you will experience ‘safari.’<br>The country’s biggest drawcard is the Great Wildebeest Migration (this is arguably the best time to visit Tanzania). Each year, millions of wildebeest, zebra &amp; gazelle move through the Serengeti &amp; Masai Mara ecosystems in a regular pattern – in search of green pasture. Their crossing of the Mara River is the climax of this odyssey - a spectacle filled with drama, death &amp; endeavour - &amp; one of Tanzania’s best safari experiences.<br>Apart from experiencing the greatest wildlife spectacle on Earth, you can also tick off the Big 5 from their bucket list while on safari in an ancient volcano - the Ngorongoro Crater, offering the best year-round wildlife viewing in Tanzania.<br>Adventurous travellers can climb Mount Kilimanjaro - Africa’s highest mountain - while off-the-beaten-track destinations such as Rubondo Island, Ruaha National Park &amp; Nyerere National Park offer a unique safari experience like no other. You can also go chimp trekking at Lake Tanganyika or see the iconic tree-climbing lions at Tarangire National Park or Lake Manyara. But Tanzania is not just about safaris. Home to the beautiful Zanzibar Island, travellers can easily combine bush &amp; beach in one holiday.</p>\n<h4>Stay</h4>\n<p>As one of Africa’s classic safari destinations, Tanzania’s accommodation options reflect luxury safari lodges, remote tented camps &amp; popular safari hotels. Choices range from comfortable &amp; affordable to exceptional &amp; indulgent - &amp; everything in between.</p>\n<h4>When to travel</h4>\n<p>The best time to visit Tanzania &amp; go on safari is during the dry season, from late June to October, when wildlife viewing is generally at its best. The Wildebeest Migration in the Serengeti is usually between June &amp; August &amp; the time to see the wildebeest calving is from late January to March.<br>The best time to visit Zanzibar is from June to October during the long dry season or January to February during the short dry season. The long rainy season is between March &amp; May &amp; the short rainy season is during November &amp; December. During this time tropical downpours are the norm &amp; humidity is high.<br>MIGRATION EXPLAINED<br>JANUARY<br>In January, the herds move south from the northeast region into the area near Lake Ndutu.<br>FEBRUARY &amp; MARCH<br>February to March is calving season when over 8,000 wildebeest babies are born each day, so guests can witness the bittersweet interaction between fierce predators &amp; wobbly calves.<br>APRIL &amp; MAY<br>Between April &amp; May, the herds generally move northwest towards the Moru &amp; Simba Kopjes. Breeding is now in full swing &amp; around May the calves are stronger, so the herds move a little quicker into the central Serengeti.<br>JUNE<br>During June, they are usually in the central Serengeti &amp; preparing for the toughest part of their journey. The herds may have split up, with some already crossing the Grumeti River.<br>JULY<br>During July, they have reached the Grumeti region &amp; northern parts of the Serengeti, facing their biggest obstacle yet: the crocodile-infested waters of the Mara River.<br>AUGUST<br>August is generally the best time to witness river crossings from the northern Serengeti to the Masai Mara.<br>SEPTEMBER<br>In September, the herd breaks into smaller groups, with the majority crossing over to the Masai Mara &amp; some (less than half) remain in the northern Serengeti.<br>OCTOBER<br>In October, the best chance to see them is still in the Masai Mara. Opt to stay in one of the less-crowded private conservancies where off-road driving &amp; night drives are permitted.<br>NOVEMBER<br>Normally, the short rains begin in November - tempting the wildebeest to leave the dry Mara for the rejuvenated Serengeti. Generally, they can be seen in the Serengeti’s northeastern region where they may split into smaller groups before continuing their journey southward.<br>DECEMBER<br>In December, the herds move south towards fresh grazing &amp; cover the northern &amp; eastern Serengeti in preparation for another action-packed 3,000km journey.</p>\n","images":["optimized-images/safaris/tanzania/1tanzania-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/tanzania/2tanzania-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/tanzania/3tanzania-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/tanzania/4tanzania-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/tanzania/5tanzania-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/tanzania/6tanzania-1-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/tanzania/7tanzania-1-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/tanzania/8tanzania-1-large.webp"],"subfolders":[{"title":"Arusha","description":"Welcome to Arusha!
