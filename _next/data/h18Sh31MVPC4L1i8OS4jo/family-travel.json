This is the recipe for a successful family holiday!</p>\n<p>This is where we come in. At Africa Unwind, our job is to ensure that careful planning goes into your family safari vacation or beach getaway, ensuring that you &amp; your little ones have the time of your lives.</p>\n<p>From witnessing close-up animal encounters &amp; sleeping in a treehouse to exciting treasure hunts &amp; swimming with dolphins – Africa has it all!</p>\n<p>Want to know more?</p>\n<p>Here are our top 6 reasons why an African family safari or island-style getaway is your best choice:</p>\n<h4>WITNESS FASCINATING ANIMAL ENCOUNTERS</h4>\n<p>Travelling to Africa with your family means one thing – the best family safari holiday ever! This bucket list activity is why most visitors choose Africa as their holiday destination. And if you ever want to see true excitement on a child’s face – bring them along! Apart from experiencing family game drives while on safari, kids can also enjoy elephant-back rides, walk with penguins on the beach, have breakfast with giraffes or interact with meerkats. You can also watch baby turtles nest on a postcard-perfect island or witness whales calve from a boat.</p>\n<h4>STAY IN PRIVATE VILLAS</h4>\n<p>Family travel can be tricky when it comes to finding the right accommodation. Private villas are often the best way to go. Whether youchoose a luxury family safari lodge, or an ocean-view suite, you’ll have everything you need for a true home-away-from-home experience &amp; enjoy the added benefit of dedicated staff who will look after your every need.</p>\n<h4>HAVE FUN AT THE KIDS CLUB</h4>\n<p>In Africa, fun is around every corner. Many beach resorts &amp; safari lodges boast dedicated Kids Clubs that offer a wide selection of fun-filled activities for your little ones. Should parents wish to enjoy a quiet dinner every so often, kids can play their hearts out at the Kids Club or alternatively, babysitting can be arranged.</p>\n<h4>EXPLORE AT YOUR OWN PACE</h4>\n<p>Families are often independent travellers who like to explore at their own pace, without being tied down to a certain schedule. That is where self-drive holidays come into play. Certain countries in Africa have great infrastructure that allows for safe &amp; easy self-drive vacations.</p>\n<h4>CHOOSE MALARIA-FREE</h4>\n<p>There are many African destinations that are malaria-free – which means that you can still go on your dream family safari vacation, soak up the sun on a tropical island or enjoy adventurous activities with your kids - even while you are pregnant. We are here to recommend the best malaria-free family-friendly destinations – just ask.</p>\n<h4>ENJOY FAMILY-FRIENDLY ACTIVITIES</h4>\n<p>Our beautiful continent offers a long list of family-friendly activities, so rest assured that no one will get bored during an African family vacation. Whether you are coming face to face with a lion (from the comfort &amp; safety of a safari jeep), riding on the back of an elephant, ziplining through a forest, riding on a quad bike or going on a treasure hunt – Africa will thrill the whole family!</p>\n","images":["optimized-images/family-travel/1familytravel-large.webp","optimized-images/family-travel/2familytravel-large.webp","optimized-images/family-travel/3familytravel-large.webp","optimized-images/family-travel/4familytravel-large.webp","optimized-images/family-travel/5familytravel-large.webp","optimized-images/family-travel/6familytravel-large.webp","optimized-images/family-travel/7familytravel-large.webp","optimized-images/family-travel/8familytravel-large.webp"],"subfolders":[{"title":"Witness Fascinating Animal Encounters","description":"All children love animals, &amp; in Africa – there is a lot of love going around!   Not only will your family be able to tick off the Big 5 while on safari, but there are many other interesting animal encounters that will leave you n awe. This is something that the whole family can enjoy, because – let’s be honest – not many of us are used to interacting with wild animals in their natural habitat.","image":"optimized-images/family-travel/1witness-fascinating-animal-encounters/1witnessfascinatinganimalencounters-small.webp","folderName":"family-travel/1witness-fascinating-animal-encounters","created":null},{"title":"Stay In Private Villas","description":"Let’s be honest – although hotels are luxurious &amp; amazing, spending a lot of time in a hotel room with (small) children, is not quite what Mum &amp; Dad had in mind when planning a family holiday! The ideal is to have a home-away-from-home environment – with ample space for the little ones to run around, a swimming pool, fun-filled activities &amp; relaxing zones for Mum &amp; Dad!  We are sure that all parents will agree:  Happy kids, happy parents! So, if you are travelling with your family, the first prize is to stay in private villas where you’ll have all of the above, plus dedicated staff who will look after your every need.

But often ‘fun for Mum &amp; Dad’, doesn’t necessarily mean ‘fun for the kids!’ (&amp; vice versa) But when your family travels to Africa, we’ll make sure that ‘fun’ is indeed for the whole family. One of the best ways to ensure that everyone is happy is to pick family-friendly lodges with Kids Clubs. That way, the little ones can play at their heart’s content, learn about Africa &amp; enjoy a variety of fun activities while Mum &amp; Dad enjoy an afternoon siesta.    There are wonderful Kids Clubs throughout Africa, but we’ll share some of our favourites with you – so start packing &amp; get ready for oodles of family fun!","image":"optimized-images/family-travel/3have-fun-at-the-kids-club/1havefunatthekidsclub-small.webp","folderName":"family-travel/3have-fun-at-the-kids-club","created":null},{"title":"Explore At Your Own Pace","description":"Travelling with kids &amp; adhering to set schedules can be challenging for some, so if you are an independent family who loves to explore at your own pace – why not rent a car &amp; self-drive through South Africa or Nambia? Both these countries have fantastic infrastructure &amp; spectacular scenery to enjoy along the way – the ideal combination for an exciting road trip adventure! South Africa stands out above the rest when it comes to family-friendly lodges &amp; activities – so of, course we’ll recommend that you make this beautiful country your first pit stop.","image":"optimized-images/family-travel/4explore-at-your-own-pace/1exploreatyourownpace-small.webp","folderName":"family-travel/4explore-at-your-own-pace","created":null},{"title":"Choose Malaria-free","description":"Everyone will agree that Africa is a bucket list destination – even if you are pregnant or travelling with young kids.
