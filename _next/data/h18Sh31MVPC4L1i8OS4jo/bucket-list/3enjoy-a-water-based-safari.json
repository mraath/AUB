These lions climb trees to have a better vantage point for spotting the various prey that can be seen loitering around the park. These big cats can easily pounce on their food without easily being noticed. They also climb trees to escape the heat from the ground &amp get shelter from the rain.\nApart from the fact that Queen Elizabeth National Park offers the perfect blend between a classic savanna style safari &amp a chimpanzee trekking safari in the silver forest of Kyambura Gorge, the park’s real reward lies in its ability to offer a diverse range of safari activities.\n\nBoat cruises along the Kazinga Channel is usually a highlight, given the rewarding game viewing &amp bird watching en-route, while Kyambura Gorge offers a lush green forest to explore, home to chimpanzees &amp other primates. Savanna game viewing activities include open 4x4 drives while chimpanzee trekking safaris are on foot – an exciting contrast &amp a wonderful way to connect with Uganda’s fauna &amp flora.\n\nQueen Elizabeth National Park is open all year long, but wildlife viewing is at its best during the dry seasons from January to February &amp June to September. However, this scenic park is at its most beautiful in the wet seasons from March to May &amp October to December when bird watching is at its best.","image":"optimized-images/default.webp","folderName":"safaris/uganda/queen-elizabeth-national-park","created":null},{"title":"Okavango Delta Lodges","description":"Explore Botswana's Luxury Safari Lodges in the Okavango Delta - An Oasis of Serenity.
