Wildlife enthusiasts flock to the Serengeti to witness nature's grand spectacle: The Great Wildebeest Migration. Every year, millions of wildebeest, zebras, &amp gazelles follow a migratory path across the Serengeti in search of greener pastures. Observing massive herds braving crocodile-infested rivers &amp eluding hungry predators like Africa's big cats is the essence of the Serengeti experience.\nThroughout the year, expect extraordinary wildlife encounters, including the exhilarating predator-prey drama of calving season (February to March).\n\nSerengeti National Park offers a wide array of wildlife-centered activities, including open 4x4 game drives, guided walks, captivating hot air balloon safaris, &amp rewarding birdwatching.

This period not only offers superb wildlife encounters but also showcases the pinnacle of the Wildebeest Migration. While wildlife viewing is excellent year-round, specific areas shine during different times. Keep in mind that the entire migration is orchestrated by rainfall.

Opt to stay in one of the less-crowded private conservancies where off-road driving & night drives are permitted.\nNOVEMBER: Normally, the short rains begin in November - tempting the wildebeest to leave the dry Mara for the rejuvenated Serengeti. Generally, they can be seen in the Serengeti’s northeastern region where they may split into smaller groups before continuing their journey southward.\nDECEMBER: In December, the herds move south towards fresh grazing & cover the northern & eastern Serengeti in preparation for another action-packed 3,000 km journey.","image":"optimized-images/default.webp","folderName":"safaris/tanzania/serengeti-national-park","created":null},{"title":"SOSSUSVLEI","description":"Sossusvlei, nestled at the heart of Namibia's renowned Namib Naukluft National Park, is unequivocally one of Namibia's premier safari destinations.

During the low season, there are more baby animals to see, &amp birding is excellent.\nHowever, the absolute best time to witness the world-famous Wildebeest Migration is usually between August &amp November, depending on rainfall patterns.

Breeding is now in full swing, &amp by May, the calves are stronger, allowing the herds to move a bit quicker into the central Serengeti.\nJUNE\nIn June, they are typically in the central Serengeti, preparing for the most challenging part of their journey. Some herds may have split up, with a few already crossing the Grumeti River.\nJULY\nJuly sees them reach the Grumeti region and northern parts of the Serengeti, facing their greatest obstacle yet: the crocodile-infested waters of the Mara River.\nAUGUST\nAugust is usually the best time to witness the river crossings from the northern Serengeti to the Masai Mara.\nSEPTEMBER\nIn September, the herds break into smaller groups, with most crossing over to the Masai Mara, while some (less than half) remain in the northern Serengeti.\nOCTOBER\nIn October, the best chance to see them is still in the Masai Mara.
