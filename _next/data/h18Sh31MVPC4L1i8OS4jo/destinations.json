Well, yes. Because – for most of us, our favourite memories happen while on holiday.  Perhaps it is because we forget the rat race, the job, the responsibilities & the dog at home (of course you got a sitter), & we focus on the things that really matter.  People.  You’ll hear us talk about people often, because – if we are truly honest with ourselves – life revolves around doing things together.  Sure, travel is always fun, but sharing an adventure with someone is even better! Have you ever sat around a dinner table & listened to someone’s amazing (& often funny) travel stories? “The day we missed our flight & got upgraded to first class.”  “That time we couldn’t get to our chalet, because a hippo was blocking the door.” “Remember when we slept in the treehouse & got woken up by the roar of a lion?”  ","image":"optimized-images/blog/anothertravelblog-small.webp","folderName":"blog","created":null},{"title":"Bucket List","description":"What is a bucket list?

Like many people, I knew what I wanted to do with my life when I was just 10 years old. A Hollywood actress. And like many of those people, life turned out a little different…But ‘different’ is what I have learned to embrace. See, ‘different’ also means ‘out of the ordinary’ - & this is exactly what I have found on my first-ever trip to another country. At the age of 19, I hopped on a plane, left my world & my ways behind & stepped into a different world where people spoke a different language, ate different food & showed me that ‘different’ is pretty special.","image":"optimized-images/our-story/1ourstory-small.webp","folderName":"our-story","created":null},{"title":"SAFARIS","description":"Perhaps everyone on Planet Earth has dreamed of going on safari to Africa!
