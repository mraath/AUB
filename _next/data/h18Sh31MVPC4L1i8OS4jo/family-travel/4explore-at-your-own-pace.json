Along with the accommodation booking, she offered us a range of recommended activities in the area. All of which were great! \nWe appreciated the attention to detail, it removed all the guess work & uncertainty from the trip, ensuring that we relaxed and enjoyed the itinerary. We’ll definitely make use of Africa Unwind in the future!\nFrom the moment we arrived at Christiana Lodge, the owner Christine treated us like family. The rooms were beautiful, with lovely large white towels, crisp, clean linen & sublime views. We were offered various dinner options with complimentary reservations done on our behalf. The service was excellent. Depending on your family, we’d highly recommend the self -catering cottage, which provided us with ample space - especially on the few rainy days we had. \nThe highlight of each morning was breakfast. A delicious menu of which we sampled everything over the course of our holiday. Each member of the family had their favourite & there was often a debate over who should be having the pancakes…again….\nBeing walking distance to the beach was also brilliant. We enjoyed some sundowner strolls. The lodge is also really close to the Robberg Nature Reserve walk, which was one of the favourite memories of our trip. Ensure you have enough sunscreen & water. A truly remarkable walk of diversity; from sea cliffs, to dunes to beach.\nWe really felt looked after. It was a wonderful stay in a beautiful, quiet part of Plettenberg Bay. Highly recommended!\nThe Bilton Family","image":"optimized-images/default.webp","folderName":"blog/our-clients-say/garden-route-getaway","created":null}],"parentCards":[{"title":"Witness Fascinating Animal Encounters","image":"optimized-images/family-travel/1witness-fascinating-animal-encounters/1witnessfascinatinganimalencounters-small.webp","folderName":"family-travel/1witness-fascinating-animal-encounters","isCurrentFolder":false},{"title":"Stay In Private Villas","image":"optimized-images/family-travel/2stay-in-private-villas/1stayinprivatevillas-small.webp","folderName":"family-travel/2stay-in-private-villas","isCurrentFolder":false},{"title":"Have Fun At The Kids Club","image":"optimized-images/family-travel/3have-fun-at-the-kids-club/1havefunatthekidsclub-small.webp","folderName":"family-travel/3have-fun-at-the-kids-club","isCurrentFolder":false},{"title":"Explore At Your Own Pace","image":"optimized-images/family-travel/4explore-at-your-own-pace/1exploreatyourownpace-small.webp","folderName":"family-travel/4explore-at-your-own-pace","isCurrentFolder":true},{"title":"Choose Malaria-free","image":"optimized-images/family-travel/5choose-malaria-free/1choosemalaria-free-small.webp","folderName":"family-travel/5choose-malaria-free","isCurrentFolder":false},{"title":"Enjoy Family-friendly Activities","image":"optimized-images/family-travel/6enjoy-family-friendly-activities/1enjoyfamily-friendlyactivities-small.webp","folderName":"family-travel/6enjoy-family-friendly-activities","isCurrentFolder":false}],"h1Title":"Explore At Your Own Pace","h2Title":"Family Travel Experiences","h3Title":"Explore At Your Own Pace","whatWeLoveItems":[],"params":{"slug":["family-travel","4explore-at-your-own-pace"]},"level":2},"__N_SSG":true}
