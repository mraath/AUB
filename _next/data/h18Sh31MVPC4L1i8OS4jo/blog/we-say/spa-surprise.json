(Everyone needs friends like ours!)<br>The thought of getting pampered, detoxing in the steam room &amp; swimming in a heated pool got us so excited, we decided to stay the entire weekend.<br>And the reason I am blogging about this, is because we all know how amazing (&amp; tiring) travel can be.  When booking a holiday, we spend so much time exploring the area, dining out &amp; taking pictures, that we forget about the ‘unwinding part of the trip!’<br>So, I say: ‘Go for it!”  Treat yourself.  By all means – explore, travel &amp; repeat.  But balance it with something that relaxes you.  For me, that is massages &amp; facials!<br>So off we went…<br>Upon arrival at Majeka House, a boutique hotel set in the historic town of Stellenbosch in the Cape Winelands, we checked into our room &amp; decided to spend the afternoon relaxing by the heated pool.  After sunset, we enjoyed a lovely dinner next to the fireplace – the perfect ending to a day in the Winelands.  We particularly enjoyed their healthy poke bowls – in fact – we had it twice during our stay!<br>The next morning, after a delicious breakfast served in the restaurant overlooking lush gardens, we were ready for our day of pampering!<br>The Wellness Spa at Majeka House offers a wide range of spa treatments, including the complimentary use of the heated pool, steam room, sauna &amp; Jacuzzi.<br>Their Spa Menu includes massages, facials, body wraps &amp; scrubs, hand &amp; feet treatments, waxing, nail treatments &amp; much more.<br>You are also more than welcome to tailor your own package from their Spa Menu.<br>We decided on the Majeka Magic Package, which includes a 45 min back &amp; foot massage, a 60 min bespoke facial &amp; a lunch.  This package is tailored to couples, so we were booked into the larger treatment room with 2 massage beds.<br>Their well-trained &amp; experienced therapists were attentive to our personal needs &amp; treated us like royalty.<br>After our pampering session, we put on white, fluffy robes &amp; enjoyed an amazing lunch in the gardens.  The rest of the day was spent reading on the pool loungers, swimming &amp; detoxing in the steam room &amp; Jacuzzi.<br>When travelling, we enjoy staying at properties that offer spa facilities, because there is always time for a little bit of pampering.<br>Most of Africa Unwind’s clients enjoy booking private tours to Cape Town &amp; the Winelands, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t time for a relaxing treatment in the afternoon.<br>Or even better – stay an extra night &amp; get pampered properly before flying back home!<br>Aren’t holidays about relaxing…?  So, do that!<br>Come to Africa…&amp; Unwind.</p>\n","images":["optimized-images/blog/we-say/spa-surprise/1spasurprise-large.webp","optimized-images/blog/we-say/spa-surprise/2spasurprise-large.webp","optimized-images/blog/we-say/spa-surprise/3spasurprise-large.webp","optimized-images/blog/we-say/spa-surprise/4spasurprise-large.webp","optimized-images/blog/we-say/spa-surprise/5spasurprise-large.webp","optimized-images/blog/we-say/spa-surprise/6spasurprise-large.webp","optimized-images/blog/we-say/spa-surprise/7spasurprise-large.webp","optimized-images/blog/we-say/spa-surprise/8spasurprise-large.webp"],"subfolders":[{"title":"Mother City","description":"Everyone loves Cape Town.  Full stop.  This article is finished. The only reason I continue to write, is because there is so much to say about South Africa’s most beautiful city.  You may think I am biased since I was born here & grew up here – but then I meet people from other countries around the world who agree with me - & I realise, I am right! (She said humbly.) This is why my family & I often pretend we are tourists in our own city.  We go to the beach, we visit the penguins at Boulders Beach, we hike to the top of Table Mountain (or on lazy days – we take the cable car) & each time, we realise how fortunate we are to call this place home.","image":"optimized-images/blog/we-say/mother-city/1mothercity-small.webp","folderName":"blog/we-say/mother-city","created":"1 February 2023"},{"title":"Spa Surprise","description":"If you know me well, you’ll know that I get excited about these 3 things:  People, travel &amp; spa treatments!

But we are not most people.  My husband &amp; I don’t even drink wine (please don’t judge us!) – but we decided to investigate 2 of the most popular self-drive routes in South Africa to see if they are truly as spectacular as everyone says. Nestled between sun-kissed vineyards &amp; majestic mountains, the picturesque valleys of the Wine Route (also referred to as the Cape Winelands) are renowned for their exquisite wines, grand old estates, pretty towns &amp; award-winning restaurants.","image":"optimized-images/blog/we-say/wine-whales/1wine-whales-small.webp","folderName":"blog/we-say/wine-whales","created":"1 September 2022"},{"title":"Family Fun","description":"OK, Let’s be honest – traveling with kids can be fun (or not).

So, from now on I will refer to this term (Islands + Luxury) as ‘Island Extraordinaire’, because if you continue to read until the end, you’ll understand why our recent trip to Mozambique was exactly that - Extraordinary! Since I was a young girl, I dreamt about being whisked away to a romantic island retreat where my villa was right on the sand.  I have always wanted to be surrounded by turquoise blue water &amp; palm trees while eating fresh seafood on the beach…We would watch a romantic sunset, enjoy adventurous watersports &amp; get pampered at the spa…&amp; then I would wake up!","image":"optimized-images/blog/we-say/island-extraordinaire/1islandextraordinaire-small.webp","folderName":"blog/we-say/island-extraordinaire","created":"1 July 2022"},{"title":"Sunny Safari","description":"“Wow, I am excited about this trip!” I thought while packing. Safari outfits?  Check.  Camera?  Check.  Swim gear?  Check.  After I have packed these three essentials, I almost felt like the rest of the things on my list were suddenly not so important anymore.  (But with kids, you always need to pack more!  So I did.) We were staying along the scenic Garden Route &amp; already experienced a bag full of family fun – ziplining through the forest, hiking, water park thrills &amp; elephant encounters – so it was time for our bush adventure!","image":"optimized-images/blog/we-say/sunny-safari/1sunnysafari-small.webp","folderName":"blog/we-say/sunny-safari","created":"1 June 2022"}],"parentCards":[{"title":"All Things Africa","image":"optimized-images/blog/all-things-africa/1-all-things-africa-small.webp","folderName":"blog/all-things-africa","isCurrentFolder":false},{"title":"Our Clients Say","image":"optimized-images/blog/our-clients-say/1-clients-say-small.webp","folderName":"blog/our-clients-say","isCurrentFolder":false},{"title":"We Say","image":"optimized-images/blog/we-say/1-we-say-small.webp","folderName":"blog/we-say","isCurrentFolder":true}],"h1Title":"Spa Surprise","h2Title":"We Say","h3Title":"Spa Surprise","whatWeLoveItems":[],"params":{"slug":["blog","we-say","spa-surprise"]},"level":3},"__N_SSG":true}
