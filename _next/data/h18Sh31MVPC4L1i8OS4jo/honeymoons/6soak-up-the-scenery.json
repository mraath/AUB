Opt to stay in one of the less-crowded private conservancies where off-road driving & night drives are permitted.\nNOVEMBER: Normally, the short rains begin in November - tempting the wildebeest to leave the dry Mara for the rejuvenated Serengeti. Generally, they can be seen in the Serengeti’s northeastern region where they may split into smaller groups before continuing their journey southward.\nDECEMBER: In December, the herds move south towards fresh grazing & cover the northern & eastern Serengeti in preparation for another action-packed 3,000 km journey.","image":"optimized-images/default.webp","folderName":"safaris/tanzania/serengeti-national-park","created":null},{"title":"MASAI MARA","description":"The Masai Mara National Reserve &amp its neighboring conservancies form Kenya's flagship conservation area &amp are undoubtedly one of Africa's top safari destinations.\nThe vast, open plains of the Mara attract an abundance of wildlife, including elephants, buffalos, zebras, giraffes, hyenas, &amp the Mara's iconic big cats: lions, leopards, &amp cheetahs.\nOne of the world's greatest wildlife spectacles unfolds here each year between August &amp November.

High season (June to October) brings cooler, drier weather &amp more crowds, while low season (November to March) offers warmer, wetter conditions &amp fewer visitors. During the low season, there are more baby animals to see, &amp birding is excellent.\nHowever, the absolute best time to witness the world-famous Wildebeest Migration is usually between August &amp November, depending on rainfall patterns. The Mara's resident animals give birth between December &amp January during calving season.\nMIGRATION EXPLAINED\nJANUARY\nIn January, the herds move south from the northeast region to the area near Lake Ndutu.\nFEBRUARY &amp MARCH\nFebruary to March is calving season when over 8,000 wildebeest babies are born each day, offering the chance to witness the bittersweet interaction between fierce predators &amp wobbly calves.\nAPRIL &amp MAY\nBetween April &amp May, the herds generally move northwest towards the Moru &amp Simba Kopjes. Breeding is now in full swing, &amp by May, the calves are stronger, allowing the herds to move a bit quicker into the central Serengeti.\nJUNE\nIn June, they are typically in the central Serengeti, preparing for the most challenging part of their journey. Some herds may have split up, with a few already crossing the Grumeti River.\nJULY\nJuly sees them reach the Grumeti region and northern parts of the Serengeti, facing their greatest obstacle yet: the crocodile-infested waters of the Mara River.\nAUGUST\nAugust is usually the best time to witness the river crossings from the northern Serengeti to the Masai Mara.\nSEPTEMBER\nIn September, the herds break into smaller groups, with most crossing over to the Masai Mara, while some (less than half) remain in the northern Serengeti.\nOCTOBER\nIn October, the best chance to see them is still in the Masai Mara. Opt to stay in one of the less-crowded private conservancies that permit off-road driving &amp night drives.\nNOVEMBER\nTypically, the short rains begin in November, tempting the wildebeests to leave the dry Mara for the rejuvenated Serengeti. You can usually spot them in the Serengeti's northeastern region, where they may split into smaller groups before continuing their southward journey.\nDECEMBER\nIn December, the herds move south toward fresh grazing, covering the northern &amp eastern Serengeti in preparation for another action-packed 3,000-kilometre journey.\nExplore the magic of the Masai Mara &amp witness nature's grand spectacle.","image":"optimized-images/default.webp","folderName":"safaris/kenya/masai-mara","created":null},{"title":"LAKE MALAWI","description":"When you stare out over the palm-fringed sandy beach with crystal-clear water, it is easy to think you are on an oceanic tropical island rather than the shores of Lake Malawi – one of the world’s largest freshwater lakes.\nCovering 30,000 square km &amp taking up a large slice of Malawi, this freshwater body is home to the largest number of fish species in the world, making this an ideal destination for water sport enthusiasts.\nHere, in what people call ‘the friendliest country in Africa,’ guests can enjoy freshwater snorkelling, scuba diving, kayaking, sailing &amp fishing.\nAccommodation is mostly found around the lake’s southern &amp central regions, but even in the more visited areas, the lake remains wonderfully untouched by mass tourism.
