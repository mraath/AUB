The 9,000 sq km reserve is still largely unexplored, but at its focal point, you will find the meandering Luangwa River – a huge drawcard for thirsty animals.<br>Luxurious camps &amp; lodges are scattered along the Luangwa River, boasting spectacular views over the water’s edge where large herds of elephants &amp; buffaloes as well as lion, hippo &amp; crocodile gather to quench their thirst.<br>South Luangwa also has a high density of leopard as well as endemic species such Crawshay’s zebra &amp; Thornicroft’s giraffe, plus all the plains game such as zebra, Thomson’s gazelle &amp; antelope.</p>\n<h4>Activities</h4>\n<p>This park was the birthplace of guided walking safaris &amp; still takes the prize as the best place in Africa to experience the thrill of walking through big game country.<br>Expert guides, many of whom grew up in the area, will take you on a journey through Africa’s most remote &amp; unexplored regions - on foot as well as on open 4x4 game drives.<br>Adventurous travellers can choose to overnight at a remote tented camp where the focus is on walking safaris, after which they can end their safari at one of the luxurious lodges on the banks of the Luangwa River – the ideal place to relax in style.</p>\n<h4>When to travel</h4>\n<p>The best time to travel to South Luangwa National Park is during the dry season, which is from May to October - with wildlife season peaking from July. Water in the bush has dried up, so animals congregate around the Luangwa River &amp; other water sources.<br>Note that October &amp; November are extremely hot, &amp; some people may find conditions difficult to cope with during these months.<br>Much of South Luangwa National Park gets flooded during the wet summer season (from November to April), so many camps close during this time &amp; reopen after the rains have ended in April.</p>\n","images":["AUB/optimized-images/safaris/zambia/south-luangwa-national-park/1southluangwa-large.webp","AUB/optimized-images/safaris/zambia/south-luangwa-national-park/2southluangwa-large.webp","AUB/optimized-images/safaris/zambia/south-luangwa-national-park/3southluangwa-large.webp","AUB/optimized-images/safaris/zambia/south-luangwa-national-park/4southluangwa-large.webp","AUB/optimized-images/safaris/zambia/south-luangwa-national-park/5southluangwa-large.webp","AUB/optimized-images/safaris/zambia/south-luangwa-national-park/6southluangwa-large.webp","AUB/optimized-images/safaris/zambia/south-luangwa-national-park/7southluangwa-large.webp","AUB/optimized-images/safaris/zambia/south-luangwa-national-park/8southluangwa-large.webp"],"subfolders":[{"title":"Bilimungwe Bushcamp","description":"Bilimungwe Bushcamp enjoys an ideal location in the wild &amp; unspoilt region of Zambia’s South Luangwa National Park.
