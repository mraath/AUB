What sets it apart is its ability to attract fewer visitors compared to its northern counterparts.<br>Nyerere National Park boasts pristine and untouched landscapes, offering visitors an authentic safari experience in one of Africa&#39;s last remaining wildernesses. A standout feature is the allowance for off-road driving, enabling visitors to get up close and personal with the area&#39;s resident wildlife.</p>\n<h4>Activities</h4>\n<p>One of the most sought-after activities in Nyerere National Park is extended treks through the bush, with overnight fly-camps along the way—an adventure traveler&#39;s dream come true! Permanent lodges in the area offer a range of exciting activities, including open 4x4 game drives &amp;amp boating safaris along the Rufiji River. Guests can also indulge in guided walking safaris, bird watching, bush breakfasts, &amp;amp romantic sundowner excursions.</p>\n<h4>When to travel</h4>\n<p>For the best wildlife viewing experience in Nyerere National Park, plan your visit between June &amp;amp October during the dry season when animals congregate at water sources, &amp;amp the thinner vegetation makes animal spotting easier. While the wet season, from October to May, paints the scenery lush &amp;amp green, afternoons can become unbearably hot. Note that many lodges close their doors between March &amp;amp May.</p>\n","images":["optimized-images/safaris/tanzania/nyerere-national-park-selous-game-reserve/1Nyerere-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/tanzania/nyerere-national-park-selous-game-reserve/2Nyerere-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/tanzania/nyerere-national-park-selous-game-reserve/3Nyerere-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/tanzania/nyerere-national-park-selous-game-reserve/4Nyerere-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/tanzania/nyerere-national-park-selous-game-reserve/5Nyerere-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/tanzania/nyerere-national-park-selous-game-reserve/6Nyerere-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/tanzania/nyerere-national-park-selous-game-reserve/7Nyerere-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/tanzania/nyerere-national-park-selous-game-reserve/8Nyerere-large.webp"],"subfolders":[{"title":"Beho Beho Camp","description":"Set in the remote Nyerere National Park (Selous Game Reserve), Beho Beho Camp enjoys a spectacular setting on the slopes of the Namikwera Hill, overlooking the Rufiji River floodplain.
