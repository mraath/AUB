This is the recipe for a successful family holiday!</p>\n<p>This is where we come in. At Africa Unwind, our job is to ensure that careful planning goes into your family safari vacation or beach getaway, ensuring that you &amp; your little ones have the time of your lives.<br>From witnessing close-up animal encounters &amp; sleeping in a treehouse to exciting treasure hunts &amp; swimming with dolphins – Africa has it all!<br>Want to know more?<br>Here are our top 6 reasons why an African family safari or island-style getaway is your best choice:</p>\n<h4>WITNESS FASCINATING ANIMAL ENCOUNTERS</h4>\n<p>Travelling to Africa with your family means one thing – the best family safari holiday ever! This bucket list activity is why most visitors choose Africa as their holiday destination. And if you ever want to see true excitement on a child’s face – bring them along! Apart from experiencing family game drives while on safari, kids can also enjoy elephant-back rides, walk with penguins on the beach, have breakfast with giraffes or interact with meerkats. You can also watch baby turtles nest on a postcard-perfect island or witness whales calve from a boat.</p>\n<h4>STAY IN PRIVATE VILLAS</h4>\n<p>Family travel can be tricky when it comes to finding the right accommodation. Private villas are often the best way to go. Whether youchoose a luxury family safari lodge, or an ocean-view suite, you’ll have everything you need for a true home-away-from-home experience &amp; enjoy the added benefit of dedicated staff who will look after your every need.</p>\n<h4>HAVE FUN AT THE KIDS CLUB</h4>\n<p>In Africa, fun is around every corner. Many beach resorts &amp; safari lodges boast dedicated Kids Clubs that offer a wide selection of fun-filled activities for your little ones. Should parents wish to enjoy a quiet dinner every so often, kids can play their hearts out at the Kids Club or alternatively, babysitting can be arranged.</p>\n<h4>EXPLORE AT YOUR OWN PACE</h4>\n<p>Families are often independent travellers who like to explore at their own pace, without being tied down to a certain schedule. That is where self-drive holidays come into play. Certain countries in Africa have great infrastructure that allows for safe &amp; easy self-drive vacations.</p>\n<h4>CHOOSE MALARIA-FREE</h4>\n<p>There are many African destinations that are malaria-free – which means that you can still go on your dream family safari vacation, soak up the sun on a tropical island or enjoy adventurous activities with your kids - even while you are pregnant. We are here to recommend the best malaria-free family-friendly destinations – just ask.</p>\n<h4>ENJOY FAMILY-FRIENDLY ACTIVITIES</h4>\n<p>Our beautiful continent offers a long list of family-friendly activities, so rest assured that no one will get bored during an African family vacation. Whether you are coming face to face with a lion (from the comfort &amp; safety of a safari jeep), riding on the back of an elephant, ziplining through a forest, riding on a quad bike or going on a treasure hunt – Africa will thrill the whole family!</p>\n","images":["undefined/optimized-images/family-travel/1familytravel-large.webp","undefined/optimized-images/family-travel/2familytravel-large.webp","undefined/optimized-images/family-travel/3familytravel-large.webp","undefined/optimized-images/family-travel/4familytravel-large.webp","undefined/optimized-images/family-travel/5familytravel-large.webp","undefined/optimized-images/family-travel/6familytravel-large.webp","undefined/optimized-images/family-travel/7familytravel-large.webp","undefined/optimized-images/family-travel/8familytravel-large.webp"],"subfolders":[{"title":"1Witness Fascinating Animal Encounters","description":"WITNESS FASCINATING ANIMAL ENCOUNTERS All children love animals, &amp; in Africa – there is a lot of love going around!
