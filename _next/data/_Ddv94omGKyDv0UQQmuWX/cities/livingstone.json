This extraordinary waterfall is not only listed as one of the 7 Natural Wonders of the World, it also forms the largest curtain of water on the planet &amp; can be viewed from both Zambian &amp; Zimbabwean sides.<br>A true Livingstone experience offers guests the rare opportunity to swim at Devils’ Pool - the edge of the thundering Vic Falls – a bucket list experience that should be added to everyone’s list!<br>Accommodation in Livingstone is usually geared towards the discerning traveler who are looking for a luxurious base from which to explore. A range of elegant lodges &amp; boutique hotels offer bed &amp; breakfast options while some also include activities over a 3-night stay.<br>Visitors to Livingstone can also walk across to the Zimbabwean side &amp; view the iconic Victoria Falls from both countries. (visa needed upon arrival)</p>\n<h4>Activities</h4>\n<p>Plenty of fun-filled activities and Livingstone sightseeing spots are available in Zambia. These include helicopter flights over the Falls, swimming at Devils’ Pool, Livingstone island lunches, romantic sunset boat cruises, river rafting, canoeing &amp; exciting elephant interactions.<br>For anyone who longs to view The Victoria Falls from the air, a scenic helicopter or microlight flight is usually a highlight!</p>\n<h4>When to travel</h4>\n<p>According to our Livingstone travel tips, the best time to visit the spectacular Victoria Falls is during ‘High Water’ season - from February to July, directly after the region&#39;s summer rains, when you&#39;ll see the world&#39;s largest sheet of falling water flowing at its greatest volume.<br>‘Low Water’ runs between August &amp; January &amp; is at its lowest between November &amp; early December. This is the time when there is very little spray &amp; visitors are able to fully appreciate the geological formation of Victoria Falls &amp; the full length &amp; breadth of them. River rafting &amp; swimming at Devi’s Pool are wonderful activities to experience during low season</p>\n","images":["undefined/optimized-images/cities/livingstone/1livingstone-large.webp","undefined/optimized-images/cities/livingstone/2livingstone-large.webp","undefined/optimized-images/cities/livingstone/3livingstone-large.webp","undefined/optimized-images/cities/livingstone/4livingstone-large.webp","undefined/optimized-images/cities/livingstone/5livingstone-large.webp","undefined/optimized-images/cities/livingstone/6livingstone-large.webp","undefined/optimized-images/cities/livingstone/7livingstone-large.webp","undefined/optimized-images/cities/livingstone/8livingstone-large.webp"],"subfolders":[{"title":"David Livingstone Lodge","description":"David Livingstone Lodge &amp; Spa is centrally located only 5km from the town of Livingstone in Zambia &amp; offers a unique location with breathtaking views.
