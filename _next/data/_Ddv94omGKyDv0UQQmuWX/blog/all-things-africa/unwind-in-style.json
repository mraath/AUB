Learn the top 5 reasons why a treehouse safari should be on your bucket list.</p>\n<p>Are you looking for a unique &amp; unforgettable holiday? We’ve got you covered… Experience the real Africa from a luxurious safari treehouse &amp; tick off the phrase: ‘Unwind in Style’ from your bucket list!</p>\n<pre><code>Sleeping beneath the expansive African sky is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.\n\n\nWhile you’re safely (&amp; comfortably) tucked away in your treetop hideout, you’ll witness wild animals in their natural habitat - some roaming the savanna &amp; others drinking from waterholes. \n\n\nGolden African sunsets will take your breath away with its orange &amp; pink hues of beauty. What is more magical than being lulled to sleep by the sounds of the wilderness, with nothing but a canvas of brightly burning stars as your roof? And let’s not forget that you’re doted on by exceptional staff while savouring world-class meals from the comfort of your very own luxury treehouse.\n\n\nA highlight for most treetop dwellers, is soaking in an outdoor bubble bath or enjoying a relaxing shower underneath the stars.\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Immerse yourself in nature:</h4>\n<p>Treehouses offer a unique perspective on the African wilderness, allowing you to be surrounded by natural beauty while still enjoying the comforts of ultra luxurious accommodation. You&#39;ll be able to spot wildlife from your own private vantage point &amp; truly feel at one with nature.</p>\n<h4>Sleep in a treehouse:</h4>\n<p>Imagine waking up to the sounds of the African bush &amp; falling asleep under the stars, while enjoying the extravagance of an opulent treehouse… Safari lodges spare no expense or effort when creating a luxurious African treehouse experience!</p>\n<p>  Some lodges transform hides (located near to the camp) into an oasis of rest by night, while others come in the form of ‘star beds’ on your chalet’s open rooftop deck. There are even some treehouses that are raised on stilted platforms overlooking waterholes - the perfect spot to enjoy a bird’s eye view over the bushveld.</p>\n<p>  No matter which treehouse you choose, you won’t regret it!</p>\n<h4>Escape to the trees:</h4>\n<p>Treehouses are often located in remote, untouched areas of the African wilderness, allowing you to truly get away from it all &amp; escape the hustle &amp; bustle of daily life. What could be better than experiencing this majesty all to yourself?</p>\n<h4>Experience exclusivity:</h4>\n<p>Tree houses are usually only available to a select number of guests, giving you a more exclusive &amp; private safari experience. This means you&#39;ll be able to enjoy the beauty of the African wilderness like few others dare to do.</p>\n<h4>Create lasting memories:</h4>\n<p>A tree house holiday in Africa is the perfect opportunity to create lasting memories with your loved ones. Whether it&#39;s watching the sunset over the savannah or spotting a rare species of wildlife, you&#39;ll be able to share these unforgettable moments with family &amp; friends for years to come. </p>\n<pre><code>While most treehouses are reserved for couples, a family with young kids can still enjoy this magical experience together at the Tinyeleti Treehouse in South Africa\n\n\nWhether it’s South Africa, Zimbabwe or Botswana there’s a treehouse waiting for you!
