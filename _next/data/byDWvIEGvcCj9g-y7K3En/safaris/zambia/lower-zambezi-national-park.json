This prime setting delivers wonderful views of the Zambezi River where hippos &amp;amp crocodiles are found in huge numbers &amp;amp where large herds of elephants &amp;amp buffaloes gather to quench their thirst.<br>In the open grasslands, away from the river, you will find the hunting grounds for lion, wild dog &amp;amp spotted hyena while birdlife in the park is a feast for the eyes.</p>\n<h4>Activities</h4>\n<p>Since most of the lodges &amp;amp tented camps are set on the banks of the Zambezi River, guests can enjoy land &amp;amp water-based safari activities.<br>These include open 4x4 game drives, thrilling night drives, guided walking safaris, river cruises, canoeing &amp;amp fishing.</p>\n<h4>When to travel</h4>\n<p>The best time to travel to Lower Zambezi National Park is during the dry season, which is from May to October. Animals will gather around the Zambezi River &amp;amp the grass is low, so it is easier to spot wildlife. This also coincides with Victoria Falls’ best travel season, so you can easily combine these 2 destinations &amp;amp experience the best of both worlds.<br>Note that much of the Lower Zambezi National Park gets flooded during the wet summer season (from November to April), so many camps are closed during this time &amp;amp reopen after the rains have ended in April.</p>\n","images":["/AUB/optimized-images/safaris/zambia/lower-zambezi-national-park/1lowerzambezi-large.webp","/AUB/optimized-images/safaris/zambia/lower-zambezi-national-park/2lowerzambezi-large.webp","/AUB/optimized-images/safaris/zambia/lower-zambezi-national-park/3lowerzambezi-large.webp","/AUB/optimized-images/safaris/zambia/lower-zambezi-national-park/4lowerzambezi-large.webp","/AUB/optimized-images/safaris/zambia/lower-zambezi-national-park/5lowerzambezi-large.webp","/AUB/optimized-images/safaris/zambia/lower-zambezi-national-park/6lowerzambezi-large.webp","/AUB/optimized-images/safaris/zambia/lower-zambezi-national-park/7lowerzambezi-large.webp","/AUB/optimized-images/safaris/zambia/lower-zambezi-national-park/8lowerzambezi-large.webp"],"subfolders":[{"title":"Baines' River Camp","description":"Baines’ River Camp is set on the northern bank of the mighty Zambezi River in one of Southern Africa’s wildest parks – the game-packed Lower Zambezi National Park.
