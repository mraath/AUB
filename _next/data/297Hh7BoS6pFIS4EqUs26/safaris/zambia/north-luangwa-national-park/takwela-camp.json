In this off-the-beaten-track Zambian reserve, there are only a handful of lodges, including Takwela Camp.<br>Game viewing is conducted in 4x4 game drives &amp; on walking safaris with experienced &amp; professional guides &amp; trackers – in fact, some of the best in the country!<br>Guests can be on the lookout for hyena, puku, wildebeest, eland &amp; the frequently spotted lion &amp; buffalo.  The camp is only open during the best game viewing months, from June to October.</p>\n<h4>Stay</h4>\n<p>Small &amp; intimate, Takwela has only 2 chalets sleeping 4 guests in total.  It is therefore easy to book the camp on an exclusive use basis.<br>The chalets are more rustic than luxurious, similar to those found at sister camp, Mwaleshi.  The bedrooms open up to views of the river &amp; en-suite facilities include an open-air shower.<br>Communal spaces at Takwela Camp are pleasantly rustic too.  They include lounge &amp; dining areas, both with river views.  There is also a fire pit where guests love to gather for breakfast &amp; pre-dinner drinks.</p>\n<h4>Activities</h4>\n<p>The focus at Takwela Camp is exploring the bush in open 4x4 safari vehicles as well as on foot with armed &amp; professional guides.<br>This is an unfenced property in a wildlife-rich area, so wildlife viewing also frequently happens in or around camp.</p>\n","images":["optimized-images/safaris/zambia/north-luangwa-national-park/takwela-camp/1takwelacamp-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/zambia/north-luangwa-national-park/takwela-camp/2takwelacamp-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/zambia/north-luangwa-national-park/takwela-camp/3takwelacamp-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/zambia/north-luangwa-national-park/takwela-camp/4takwelacamp-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/zambia/north-luangwa-national-park/takwela-camp/5takwelacamp-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/zambia/north-luangwa-national-park/takwela-camp/6takwelacamp-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/zambia/north-luangwa-national-park/takwela-camp/7takwelacamp-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/zambia/north-luangwa-national-park/takwela-camp/8takwelacamp-large.webp"],"subfolders":[{"title":"Mwaleshi Camp","description":"North Luangwa National Park is Africa’s best-kept secret.
