The vast, grassy floodplains are the grazing grounds for huge numbers of buffalo, wildebeest, red lechwe &amp;amp puku antelope, all of which are preyed on by predators like cheetah, wild dog, spotted hyena &amp;amp lion.<br>Apart from Kafue’s phenomenal wildlife encounters, guests can also expect spectacular pink sunrises, breathtaking scenery &amp;amp a host of exciting Zambia safari activities.<br>A Kafue safari can easily be combined with Zambia’s other wildlife regions: South Luangwa, Lower Zambezi &amp;amp the majestic Victoria Falls in Livingstone.</p>\n<h4>Activities</h4>\n<p>Kafue guests can enjoy a wide range of Zambia safari activities, including open 4x4 game drives, nocturnal-focused night drives, hot air balloon safaris, guided walks, boating, canoeing &amp;amp bird watching.<br>The water-based safaris in boats or canoes will focus on aquatic wildlife such as hippos &amp;amp crocodiles while land-based game drives will take guests straight into the world of predators. Guests can appreciate some of the smaller animals on guided walking safaris while bird lovers can add a staggering 490 species to their bird list.</p>\n<h4>When to travel</h4>\n<p>The best time to visit Kafue is from June to October during the dry season. The bush has dried out &amp;amp thirsty animals head to rivers &amp;amp waterholes, which makes these the best months for wildlife viewing.<br>Most camps in the Busanga Plains close during the wet season from December to March. April to June is considered shoulder season. During this time, the water levels are high, which means that water-based safaris can be enjoyed in full swing. Game viewing is good &amp;amp birding is excellent.</p>\n","images":["optimized-images/SAFARIS/Zambia/kafue-national-park/1Kafue-large.webp","optimized-images/SAFARIS/Zambia/kafue-national-park/2Kafue-large.webp","optimized-images/SAFARIS/Zambia/kafue-national-park/3Kafue-large.webp","optimized-images/SAFARIS/Zambia/kafue-national-park/4Busanga-large.webp","optimized-images/SAFARIS/Zambia/kafue-national-park/5Kafue-large.webp","optimized-images/SAFARIS/Zambia/kafue-national-park/6Kafue-large.webp","optimized-images/SAFARIS/Zambia/kafue-national-park/7Kafue-large.webp","optimized-images/SAFARIS/Zambia/kafue-national-park/8Kafue-1-large.webp"],"subfolders":[{"title":"Busanga Bush Camp","description":"One of only a handful of lodges in the wild Kafue National Park, Busanga Bush Camp enjoys an island location surrounded by seasonal floodplains &amp; waterways – the Busanga Plains.
