We’ve got to take our families off the beaten path &amp; experience all that this world has to offer.  Where better to do that than in Africa?  Breathtaking scenery, spectacular wildlife, pristine beaches &amp; vibrant cultures – Africa has it all!</p>\n<p>So, if you’re looking to tick off your Bucket List, start (&amp; end) in Africa.  Go on safari, sleep under the stars &amp; enjoy sundowners in the bush.  Whether you are planning a romantic getaway or a family adventure, Africa is ready to welcome you!</p>\n<p>Start packing… But first – take a look at the best African countries to visit for the vacation of your dreams.​</p>\n<h4>1. Walk on the Wild Side - Botswana​</h4>\n<p>If it’s wildlife you’re after, the best African country to visit is Botswana. Authentic &amp; truly  wild - nothing is better than enjoying up, close &amp; personal encounters with The Big Five – lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo &amp; rhino.  Botswana is ideal for couples or families who want a taste of the true African bush. Here, you can experience a safari on land or on water &amp; come face to face with Africa’s wildlife - from majestic herds of elephants in Chobe National Park, to the meerkats in the Makgadikgadi Pans. Explore the roots of the San Bushmen in the Kalahari or visit the exquisite Okavango Delta where land &amp; water meet in breathless wonder.  Known as “the river that never finds the sea,&quot; Botswana’s Okavango Delta is the largest inland delta in the world &amp; it is here where endangered species, such as wild dog, black rhino &amp; cheetah call home. For unforgettable game viewing, choose Botswana.</p>\n<h4>2. Go for the All-In-One Vacation - South Africa​</h4>\n<p>If you want to experience Africa’s best “all-in-one luxury vacation&quot; - South Africa should be Number One on your travel list!  Go from a Big Five safari experience to a sophisticated trundle along the spectacular Wine Route &amp; watch the sun set from one of the pristine beaches sprawled along the coastline.  South Africa offers something for everyone, so you can be sure to tick off the whole family&#39;s Bucket-List!  Take a lazy drive along the Whale Route or dine on decadent, world-class cuisine before soaking up uninterrupted views from your patio.</p>\n<h4>3. Experience ‘The Smoke that Thunders’ - Zimbabwe​</h4>\n<p>Hear the unmistakable roar of power when you visit Victoria Falls along the Zambezi  River in Zimbabwe. The Falls are one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World &amp; claim the title with majesty &amp; beauty.</p>\n<p>Get soaked while you marvel at the rainbows above the largest stretch of falling water in the world.  Add to your trip some of Africa’s most rewarding game viewing destinations like Hwange or Mana Pools National Park.  For exciting walking safaris &amp; close-up encounters with African elephants – Zimbabwe is the place to be!  Service is of the highest standard, so rest assured – you will relax in style!</p>\n<h4>4. Have fun in Africa’s Adventure Capital - Zambia​</h4>\n<p>For an adrenaline rush, take a trip to Livingstone in Zambia, where you can swim at the edge of the thundering Victoria Falls (season dependant) or careen down the rapids below, with a river rafting experience you won’t forget.  Add to your Bucket-List by choosing helicopter flights, elephant interactions, or sunset boat cruises along the mighty Zambezi River.  From there, head off the beaten track to some of Africa’s most remote &amp; wild destinations, while staying in absolute luxury.</p>\n<h4>5. Tick off the Great Wildebeest Migration - Tanzania​</h4>\n<p>For the ultimate safari experience, visit  Tanzania to witness the Great Wildebeest Migration where millions of wildebeest, zebra &amp; gazelle pass through in search of green pastures.  The Serengeti &amp; Masai Mara both enjoy front row seats to Africa’s matchless wildlife spectacle!  Their crossing of the Mara River is the climax of this odyssey - a spectacle filled with drama, death &amp; endeavour - &amp; definitely one for the Bucket-List.  Tanzania’s adventures don’t end there; take in the audacious beauty &amp; thrilling wildlife of the Ngorongoro Crater or tackle Mount Kilimanjaro to climb Africa’s highest peak.  Chimp trekking, tree-climbing lions &amp; an idyllic beach holiday are all at your fingertips too - Tanzania is simply a dream!</p>\n<h4>6. See the Big Cats - Kenya​</h4>\n<p>If you’re ready for the awe-inspiring pursuit of seeing a leopard lounging in a tree, a lion on the prowl or cheetah in chase, add Kenya as one of the best African countries to visit.  The Samburu National Reserve is home to all the Big Cats, so be sure to stop by if you want to experience them in all their glory.  Encounter the Great Wildebeest Migration in the Masai Mara in Kenya too &amp; pair your vacation with Rwanda to go  gorilla trekking for the ultimate African escapade.</p>\n<h4>7. Marvel at unmatched vistas - Namibia ​</h4>\n<p>Namibia offers unparalleled views across desert plains, flame-colored dunes &amp; sweeping star-filled skies.  You have the option of enjoying a self-drive holiday to see the Big Five &amp; the famous shipwrecks of the Skeleton Coast.  Or hop in an open 4x4 with an experienced guide in search of desert-adapted elephants in the rugged &amp; wild Damaraland.  Whatever you choose to experience in Namibia, you won’t want to miss a hot air balloon flight over Sossusvlei’s red sand dunes.  Bring the family on a dream vacation &amp; add in South Africa to your itinerary as the ‘cherry on top’ to a memorable Bucket-List trip.</p>\n<p>Whatever activities &amp; destinations you choose, you won’t have to drag the family around, they&#39;ll be itching to get out the door &amp; onto the next exciting experience!

Generally, the dry season is considered the optimal time for game viewing as animals are drawn to water sources, making them easier to spot. In East Africa, the dry season typically falls between June &amp; October, while in Southern Africa, it is from May to September. Africa Unwind can help you plan the perfect timing for your African Safari.</p>\n<h1></h1>\n<h4>CAN I BRING MY KIDS ON AN AFRICAN SAFARI?</h4>\n<p>Yes, bringing kids on a safari in Africa can be a wonderful &amp; enriching experience for the whole family. Many lodges offer family-friendly accommodation &amp; activities tailored to children of different ages. Going on a safari can be educational for kids as they get to witness wildlife up close, learn about different ecosystems, &amp; appreciate the natural world.</p>\n<h1></h1>\n<h4>HOW CAN I ENSURE AN ETHICAL AND RESPONSIBLE HOLIDAY IN AFRICA?</h4>\n<p>Responsible tourism is essential for preserving Africa&#39;s natural &amp; cultural heritage. When planning an African Safari vacation, you can choose lodges that prioritize sustainable practices &amp; support local communities. Look for those who follow conservation guidelines, engage in community-based tourism initiatives, &amp; contribute to wildlife conservation efforts. Respect local customs, wildlife, &amp; the environment by sticking to guidelines provided by your guides and being mindful of your impact as a visitor. Africa Unwind can point you in the direction of the best eco-conscious safari destinations.</p>\n","images":["optimized-images/blog/all-things-africa/vacation-of-your-dreams/01-the-best-african-countries-to-visit-for-vacation-of-your-dreams-large.webp","optimized-images/blog/all-things-africa/vacation-of-your-dreams/02-the-best-african-countries-to-visit-for-vacation-of-your-dreams-large.webp","optimized-images/blog/all-things-africa/vacation-of-your-dreams/03-the-best-african-countries-to-visit-for-vacation-of-your-dreams-large.webp","optimized-images/blog/all-things-africa/vacation-of-your-dreams/04-the-best-african-countries-to-visit-for-vacation-of-your-dreams-large.webp","optimized-images/blog/all-things-africa/vacation-of-your-dreams/05-the-best-african-countries-to-visit-for-vacation-of-your-dreams-large.webp","optimized-images/blog/all-things-africa/vacation-of-your-dreams/06-the-best-african-countries-to-visit-for-vacation-of-your-dreams-large.webp","optimized-images/blog/all-things-africa/vacation-of-your-dreams/07-the-best-african-countries-to-visit-for-vacation-of-your-dreams-large.webp","optimized-images/blog/all-things-africa/vacation-of-your-dreams/08-the-best-african-countries-to-visit-for-vacation-of-your-dreams-large.webp"],"subfolders":[{"title":"Discover Botswana","description":"Embark on a journey to discover why Botswana has captured the hearts of Prince Harry & Meghan Markle.
