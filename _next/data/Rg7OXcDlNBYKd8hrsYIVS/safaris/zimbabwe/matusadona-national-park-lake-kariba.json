Leopard, cheetah, wild dog, &amp; spotted hyena sightings are common, &amp; lucky guests may even catch a glimpse of both black &amp; white rhinos. Zimbabwe offers an eco-friendly safari experience in this remarkable wilderness.</p>\n<h4>Activities</h4>\n<p>At the heart of Matusadona lies Lake Kariba, where every activity dances to the rhythm of the water. Enjoy early morning game drives in search of big cats &amp; other wildlife, or unwind on leisurely afternoon boat cruises, watching hippos &amp; crocodiles in their element. The reserve is a haven for birdwatchers, &amp; adventurous souls can embark on thrilling guided walking safaris led by expert guides &amp; armed rangers. For a truly exclusive adventure, consider a fly-in experience, as Matusadona National Park is accessible only by air. This unique destination effortlessly combines with a Victoria Falls holiday or a Gonarezhou safari, making it a versatile addition to your African journey.</p>\n<h4>When to travel</h4>\n<p>For the ultimate game viewing experience, plan your trip during the dry season, from May to October. During this period, as the park&#39;s interior dries up, animals congregate along the lakeshore, offering unparalleled diversity. Expect mild &amp; sunny daily temperatures with cold nights from May to August, &amp; warmer, sometimes humid conditions in September and October. The rainy season from late November to early December can limit access &amp; wildlife visibility due to tall grass. However, from November to April, the park comes alive with spectacular birdlife. Note that some camps close from January to March but reopen in April.</p>\n","images":["optimized-images/safaris/zimbabwe/matusadona-national-park-lake-kariba/1matusadona-lakekariba-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/zimbabwe/matusadona-national-park-lake-kariba/2matusadona-lakekariba-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/zimbabwe/matusadona-national-park-lake-kariba/3matusadona-lake-kariba-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/zimbabwe/matusadona-national-park-lake-kariba/4matusadona-lakekariba-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/zimbabwe/matusadona-national-park-lake-kariba/5matusadona-lakekariba-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/zimbabwe/matusadona-national-park-lake-kariba/6matusadona-lakekariba-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/zimbabwe/matusadona-national-park-lake-kariba/7matusadona-lakekariba-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/zimbabwe/matusadona-national-park-lake-kariba/8matusadona-lakekariba-large.webp"],"subfolders":[{"title":"Bumi Hills Safari Lodge","description":"Perched on a hill overlooking the largest man-made lake in the world, Bumi Hills Safari Lodge offers breathtaking views of the Zambezi River &amp; Lake Kariba’s azure waters.
