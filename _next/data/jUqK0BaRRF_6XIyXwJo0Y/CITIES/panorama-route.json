Unspoilt mountains, majestic waterfalls &amp; interesting canyons are just some of the natural wonders and scenic spots on the Panorama Route.<br>The road conditions are easy &amp; safe, so independent-minded self-drive guests will love exploring the Panorama Route at their own pace. Alternatively, a private guide can also take you to some of the region’s best sites, such as God’s Window, Three Rondavels viewpoint, Bourke’s Luck Potholes &amp; Blyde River Canyon.<br>The Panorama Route’s charming little towns consists of Hazyview with its wide selection of outdoor activities, White River with its boutique shops, open-air restaurants &amp; golf courses, Dullstroom where fly-fishing, hiking &amp; horse-riding are at their best &amp; Pilgrim’s Rest – the Panorama Route’s historic gold mining town set in a pretty location.</p>\n<h4>Activities</h4>\n<p>The Panorama Route offers a wide selection of activities &amp; attractions. Scenic tours are usually first on the list, so guests can experience some of the area’s most beautiful sites, including waterfalls, canyons &amp; quaint towns.<br>Elephant interactions at Hazyview’s Elephant Whispers Centre is a bucket list experience that should not be missed. Other exciting activities include zip lining, golf &amp; game drives.</p>\n<h4>When to travel</h4>\n<p>The Panorama Route is beautiful in any season, but the most rewarding time to take a trip is in the cooler, dryer months between May &amp; September – which also coincides with Kruger Park’s best safari season. The driving conditions during this time of year will be better and the views clearer.</p>\n","images":["optimized-images/CITIES/panorama-route/1PanoramaRoute-large.webp","optimized-images/CITIES/panorama-route/2PanoramaRoute-large.webp","optimized-images/CITIES/panorama-route/3PanoramaRoute-large.webp","optimized-images/CITIES/panorama-route/4PanoramaRoute-large.webp","optimized-images/CITIES/panorama-route/5PanoramaRoute-large.webp","optimized-images/CITIES/panorama-route/6PanoramaRoute-large.webp","optimized-images/CITIES/panorama-route/7PanoramaRoute-large.webp","optimized-images/CITIES/panorama-route/8PanoramaRoute-large.webp"],"subfolders":[{"title":"Casterbridge Hollow Boutique Hotel","description":"With an ideal setting in White River, along the scenic Panorama Route, Casterbridge Hollow Boutique Hotel provides an ideal base from which to explore this spectacular self-drive route that leaves travellers from across the globe in awe &amp; wonder.
