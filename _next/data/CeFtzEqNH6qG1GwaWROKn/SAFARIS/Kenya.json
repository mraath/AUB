Each year, millions of wildebeest, zebra &amp; gazelle move through the Serengeti &amp; Masai Mara ecosystems in a regular pattern – in search of green pasture. Their crossing of the Mara River is the climax of this odyssey - a spectacle filled with drama, death &amp; endeavour - &amp; one of Kenya&#39;s best safari experiences.<br>Apart from ticking off the Great Migration from their bucket list, guests can also marvel at Amboseli’s picture-perfect views of Mount Kilimanjaro or enjoy thrilling encounters with Samburu’s big cats – lion, leopard &amp; cheetah.<br>Kenya also offers phenomenal Big 5 game viewing, spectacular natural beauty &amp; rich cultural encounters. It also combines easily with Tanzania &amp; Rwanda, which means that guests can add gorilla-trekking to their Kenyan safari.</p>\n<h4>Stay</h4>\n<p>Kenya offers accommodation for every type of traveller. Here, visitors can choose from exclusive, romantic hideaways, adventurous mobile expeditions or unforgettable family-friendly safaris.<br>Luxurious tented camps &amp; lodges offer the highest standard of service, ensuring that guests are comfortable throughout their stay.</p>\n<h4>When to travel</h4>\n<p>The best time to visit Kenya is during the dry season, from late June to October, when wildlife viewing is at its best.<br>The Wildebeest Migration usually reaches the Masai Mara in August and remains until October/November when they move back to the Serengeti in Tanzania.<br>MIGRATION EXPLAINED<br>JANUARY<br>In January, the herds move south from the northeast region into the area near Lake Ndutu.<br>FEBRUARY &amp; MARCH<br>February to March is calving season when over 8,000 wildebeest babies are born each day, so guests can witness the bittersweet interaction between fierce predators &amp; wobbly calves.<br>APRIL &amp; MAY<br>Between April &amp; May, the herds generally move northwest towards the Moru &amp; Simba Kopjes. Breeding is now in full swing &amp; around May the calves are stronger, so the herds move a little quicker into the central Serengeti.<br>JUNE<br>During June, they are usually in the central Serengeti &amp; preparing for the toughest part of their journey. The herds may have split up, with some already crossing the Grumeti River.<br>JULY<br>During July, they have reached the Grumeti region &amp; northern parts of the Serengeti, facing their biggest obstacle yet: the crocodile-infested waters of the Mara River.<br>AUGUST<br>August is generally the best time to witness river crossings from the northern Serengeti to the Masai Mara.<br>SEPTEMBER<br>In September, the herd breaks into smaller groups, with the majority crossing over to the Masai Mara &amp; some (less than half) remain in the northern Serengeti.<br>OCTOBER<br>In October, the best chance to see them is still in the Masai Mara. Opt to stay in one of the less-crowded private conservancies where off-road driving &amp; night drives are permitted.<br>NOVEMBER<br>Normally, the short rains begin in November - tempting the wildebeest to leave the dry Mara for the rejuvenated Serengeti. Generally, they can be seen in the Serengeti’s northeastern region where they may split into smaller groups before continuing their journey southward.<br>DECEMBER<br>In December, the herds move south towards fresh grazing &amp; cover the northern &amp; eastern Serengeti in preparation for another action-packed 3,000km journey.</p>\n","images":["optimized-images/SAFARIS/Kenya/1Kenya-large.webp","optimized-images/SAFARIS/Kenya/2Kenya-large.webp","optimized-images/SAFARIS/Kenya/3Kenya-large.webp","optimized-images/SAFARIS/Kenya/4Kenya-large.webp","optimized-images/SAFARIS/Kenya/5Kenya-large.webp","optimized-images/SAFARIS/Kenya/6Kenya-large.webp","optimized-images/SAFARIS/Kenya/7Kenya-large.webp","optimized-images/SAFARIS/Kenya/8Kenya-large.webp"],"subfolders":[{"title":"Nairobi","description":"Nairobi, Kenya’s capital, is bigger than Johannesburg &amp after decades of regular international flights, have become the unrivalled gateway to East Africa.
