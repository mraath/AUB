Spending time with endangered mountain gorillas in their natural rainforest habitat is why travellers from across the globe choose Uganda as a safari destination.<br>Uganda’s extraordinary Bwindi Impenetrable Forest boasts a 90% success rate at finding habituated gorilla family groups &amp; has contributed to gorilla trekking becoming one of Africa’s most powerful wildlife experiences.<br>But there is more to Uganda than spending time with gorillas in rainforests. This East African country is also famous for its iconic tree-climbing lions that can be found in Queen Elizabeth National Park – one of only 3 places on the continent where this rare occurrence takes place.<br>Queen Elizabeth National Park, along with Murchison Falls National Park are both big game destinations where thrilling river cruises, chimp trekking expeditions &amp; great game viewing await.<br>Kibale, in southern Uganda, supports Africa’s biggest population of chimpanzees as well as a large variety of primates &amp; 320 recorded species of bird. Mgahinga National Park boasts spectacular scenery – volcanoes, forests, crater lakes &amp; swamps - &amp; offers interesting cultural encounters with the local Batwa people.<br>Not only does Uganda offer phenomenal gorilla trekking safaris but is also known as one of the best bird-watching destinations in the world. It also combines easily with other East African countries such as Kenya &amp; Tanzania, so you can enjoy a well-rounded safari experience.</p>\n<h4>Stay</h4>\n<p>Although accommodation in Uganda is generally smaller, more intimate &amp; not as luxuriously opulent as other East African countries like Kenya or Tanzania, lodges &amp; camps still deliver plenty of comfort, friendly service &amp; great cuisine. Accommodation choices range from comfortable camps to luxurious lodges.</p>\n<h4>When to travel</h4>\n<p>The best time to visit Uganda for wildlife viewing is during the dry seasons from June to September &amp; December to February. Primate walks in the forest are a big part of any safari in Uganda. The habitat of rainforests is, by default, very wet, &amp; one can&#39;t avoid rain completely.<br>The best time to visit Uganda for bird watching is all year round but is at its peak between November &amp; April when migrant species are present. We&#39;d recommend avoiding an Uganda safari entirely during the heavy rains of April &amp; May.</p>\n","images":["optimized-images/safaris/uganda/1Uganda-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/uganda/2Uganda-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/uganda/3Uganda-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/uganda/4Uganda-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/uganda/5Uganda-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/uganda/6Uganda-1-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/uganda/7Uganda-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/uganda/8Uganda-large.webp"],"subfolders":[{"title":"Bwindi Impenetrable National Park","description":"Gorilla Trekking Safaris Uganda: Encounter mountain gorillas in their natural habitat in Bwindi Impenetrable Forest.
