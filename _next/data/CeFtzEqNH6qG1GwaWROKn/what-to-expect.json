{"pageProps":{"frontmatter":{"title":"What to expect on safari?","subtitle":"","article_title":"","canon":true},"content":"<h4></h4>\n<p>“What is a typical day on safari like?”  This is one of the first questions asked by travellers who have never been to Africa…&amp; a good one, indeed!<br>There may be slight differences based on the country you visit or the time of year you travel, but a typical safari follows a familiar rhythm that combines action-packed wildlife encounters with ample time to relax in between – the perfect blend for a dream holiday.<br>Upon arrival at each safari lodge or camp, you will be informed of the day-to-day safari program, but we thought we’ll give you a taste of a quintessential day in the African bush.<br>05h30 – 06h00:  Wake Up Call<br>Depending on what time the sun rises, you will be woken up by a friendly knock on the door &amp; a tray of coffee, tea &amp; cookies that will get you out of bed &amp; into some warm clothes – ready for the game drive!<br>06h00 – 09h00:  Morning Game Drive / Activity<br>Being out in the bush just after sunrise is simply put – magical.  Animals are at their most active during this time, so you will experience thrilling wildlife encounters from the comfort of an open 4x4 jeep.  (A dedicated guide &amp; tracker is assigned to each vehicle.)  Many animals use the early mornings to make their way to waterholes where they can quench their thirst – quite a sight to behold!<br>Some countries also offer hot air balloon safaris in the early mornings.  What is more spectacular than viewing the bush from a bird’s eye view?<br>09h00 – 10h00:  Breakfast<br>By mid-morning, the bush is hot.  Most animals have quenched their thirst &amp; start retreating to the shade.  You will return to the lodge for a delicious breakfast or brunch – usually served on a deck with spectacular views or in a remote bush setting.<br>10h00 – 13h00:  Leisure Time (Read, Nap, Swim, Spa)<br>After an eventful morning out in the bush, there is nothing quite like taking a hot shower &amp; spending the rest of the morning as you please.  Take a book down to the pool, go for a massage, hit the gym, or – frankly – take a nap!  Some lodges also have Kids Clubs, so the little ones can enjoy further adventures while the adults enjoy a little rest &amp; relaxation.<br>Most safari lodges also offer guided walking safaris after breakfast.  If you are feeling active &amp; want to experience the bush on foot, this is your chance!  Walking safaris are a fun way to learn more about animal tracking, smaller animals &amp; plants.<br>13h00 – 14h00:  Lunch<br>And just like that – it is time to eat again!  On safari, you will be treated like royalty &amp; food is an important element that cannot be overlooked.  Most travellers admit that they put on a few pounds on safari – a good indication of an enjoyable holiday!<br>14h00 – 15h30:  Leisure Time (Read, Nap, Swim, Spa)<br>After lunch, guests have a little extra leisure time to edit their photos, enjoy the peace &amp; quiet or spend time by the pool with a book in hand.  Most lodges &amp; camps boast beautiful views over the bush, &amp; some even have views over waterholes.  This is a wonderful time to take out a pair of binoculars &amp; enjoy nature in its purest form.<br>15h30 – 16h00:  High Tea<br>Just before high tea, start to get ready for your afternoon game drive or activity.  Gather your camera &amp; binoculars, put in your drinks order for sundowners &amp; if it is winter, pack a scarf, gloves &amp; beanie as it gets chilly once the sun goes down.<br>High tea is a safari tradition that was born during the unhurried days of the 19th century.  Each camp serves a scrumptious selection of nibbles – anything from cake, tart &amp; scones to savoury sandwiches &amp; traditional African bites.<br>16h00 – 19h00:  Afternoon Game Drive / Activity<br>The hottest time of day is now over &amp; it is finally cool enough for the animals to become active again.  During the afternoon game drive, just before the sun sets, guests will enjoy a special safari tradition – The Safari Sundowner – where drinks &amp; snacks are served in a scenic bush setting.<br>If you are in a private concession, the game drive will continue after dark.  You will use a spotlight to look for nocturnal animals on the way back to camp.<br>Some countries also offer other activities during the afternoons.  These include boating safaris, mokoro safaris in dug-out canoes, fishing &amp; hot air balloon rides.<br>19h00 – 21h00:  Dinner<br>Africa stokes the appetite like nowhere else on the planet!  Being out in the fresh air gets you in the mood to fill your belly – once again.  Depending on your lodge or camp, dinner may be plated, a la carte or served buffet-style, but is usually a multi-course affair accompanied by wine.<br>Some camps serve dinner in a variety of locations, so guests will have a different setting each night – alfresco on the deck, in a cosy dining room, out in the bush or in the boma - a traditional open-air area around a campfire where staff often entertain guests with traditional singing &amp; dancing.<br>21h00:  Bed Time<br>Believe it or not, but by 21h00 most guests are ready for bed!  Tomorrow is a new day &amp; wake-up is early.  The bush does not wait…</p>\n","images":["optimized-images/what-to-expect/1WhatToExpect-large.webp","optimized-images/what-to-expect/2WhatToExpect-large.webp","optimized-images/what-to-expect/3WhatToExpect-large.webp","optimized-images/what-to-expect/4WhatToExpect-large.webp","optimized-images/what-to-expect/5WhatToExpect-large.webp","optimized-images/what-to-expect/6WhatToExpect-large.webp","optimized-images/what-to-expect/7WhatToExpect-large.webp","optimized-images/what-to-expect/8WhatToExpect-large.webp"],"subfolders":[{"title":"Another Travel Blog","description":"“Another travel blog?” you ask.
