And it is no surprise to visitors when they get to experience this bucket-list destination for themselves.<br>Home to the world-renowned Moremi Game Reserve &amp; beautiful Okavango Delta with its maze of lagoons, channels &amp; islands, Botswana offers action-packed wildlife viewing in a remote setting. Witness large herds of elephants in Chobe National Park, meet the meerkats in the Makgadikgadi Pans or go on walking safaris with a San bushman in the Kalahari.<br>Botswana is all about seclusion – in fact, the only way to reach most of these camps is via small plane. Viewing the bush from a bird’s eye view is spectacular &amp; often big game can be spotted from the air. Both land &amp; water-based safari activities can be experienced in Botswana. Popular activities include open 4x4 game drives, guided walking safaris, mokoro trips in dug-out canoes, boating &amp; fishing. Botswana also easily combines with a trip to the majestic Victoria Falls.</p>\n<h4>Stay</h4>\n<p>Utterly remote &amp; beautifully luxurious, Botswana offers a variety of tented camps &amp; lodges to choose from. Most range from classic traditional safari camps to opulent bush suites, although a larger percentage of the camps in Botswana cater for the discerning traveller in search of an authentic, luxurious safari experience.</p>\n<h4>When to travel</h4>\n<p>So when is the best time to visit Botswana, you ask? Well, that depends on where you want to go. For the Moremi, Okavango Delta, Chobe, Savute, and Linyanti regions, the best time to visit is during high season, which falls between July and October. During this time, the bush is dry and the channels of the Okavango Delta are full, providing excellent game viewing opportunities.<br>If you&#39;re headed to the Central Kalahari and Makgadikgadi Pans, on the other hand, the best time to travel is during the summer season, which runs from December to March. And if you&#39;re looking for a more affordable time to visit, consider shoulder season, which falls between April and June, or November.  During these times, you&#39;ll still have a great chance to see wildlife, but rates are typically lower.<br>Lastly, if you&#39;re looking for lush greenery and amazing birdlife, consider visiting during the green season, which falls between December and March. Just keep in mind that this is the rainy season, rates will be at their lowest, but there may be some restrictions on certain activities.<br>So what are you waiting for? Start planning your trip to Botswana today and get ready for an adventure of a lifetime!</p>\n","images":["optimized-images/safaris/botswana/1botswana-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/botswana/2botswana-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/botswana/3botswana-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/botswana/4botswana-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/botswana/5botswana-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/botswana/6botswana-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/botswana/7botswana-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/botswana/8botswana-large.webp"],"subfolders":[{"title":"Chobe National Park","description":"Chobe National Park, globally acclaimed as the 'home of elephants,' is a premier destination for those seeking an unforgettable Chobe National Park elephant safari experience.
