A large part of the year, they are dry &amp;amp covered in algae while the unpredictable rain of the wet season transforms the flats into a lush, oasis – an inviting haven to thirsty animals migrating from the surrounding Kalahari Desert. For the best time to travel to Makgadikgadi Pans for wildlife viewing, consider the wet months between December to March when the rain transforms the flats into a lush oasis, attracting a variety of wildlife.<br>During the rainy season, the Makgadikgadi Pans is home to the second-largest zebra migration in the world. Water fills the pans &amp;amp the salt pans start attracting thousands of zebras &amp;amp wildebeest passing through – a wonderful sight to behold.<br>The area is also famous for its amazing meerkat encounters – the only place in Botswana where guests can enjoy interactions with one of the resident meerkat colonies.</p>\n<h4>Activities</h4>\n<p>Visitors to the Makgadikgadi will have their pick from a wide selection of exciting safari activities. A favorite remains close-up encounters &amp;amp interactions with meerkats.<br>Open 4x4 game drives &amp;amp guided nature walks with San Bushmen are also offered. Guests will learn more about their ancient culture, survival techniques &amp;amp historic way of life. Many lodges also offer romantic sleep-outs under the stars &amp;amp exciting night drives.

The best time to travel to the pans – unlike the rest of Botswana - is during the wet months between December to March. The rain transforms the flats into a lush oasis, therefore attracting a variety of wildlife. For unique experiences in Makgadikgadi Pans during the low season, consider traveling between July to October – while the rest of Botswana is experiencing high season. Temperatures are higher during this time, but you can enjoy low-season discounts for Savuti safari.</p>\n","images":["optimized-images/safaris/botswana/makgadikgadi-pans/1makgadikgadipans-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/botswana/makgadikgadi-pans/2makgadikgadipans-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/botswana/makgadikgadi-pans/3makgadikgadipans-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/botswana/makgadikgadi-pans/4makgadikgadipans-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/botswana/makgadikgadi-pans/5makgadikgadipans-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/botswana/makgadikgadi-pans/6makgadikgadipans-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/botswana/makgadikgadi-pans/7makgadikgadipans-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/botswana/makgadikgadi-pans/8makgadikgadipans-large.webp"],"subfolders":[{"title":"Camp Kalahari","description":"Camp Kalahari is an authentic tented safari camp, located in the magnificent Makgadikgadi Pans area of Botswana.
