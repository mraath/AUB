One slice of Maldives paradise we believe you have to try is Meeru Island Resort.<br>Here&#39;s why it is one of the best luxury resorts in the Maldives &amp; how you can combine your Maldives holiday with a safari in Africa for the perfect bush &amp; beach getaway.</p>\n<h4>VISIT MEERU ISLAND RESORT</h4>\n<p>Meeru Island Resort  is located in the North Male Atoll, just a 55-minute speedboat ride from the Maldives capital, Male. The resort is situated on a private island surrounded by a beautiful lagoon &amp; a long stretch of white sandy beach. Meeru Island Resort is heaven for beach lovers, offering various water activities like snorkelling, diving, &amp; sunset cruises. The resort boasts 286 villas, giving you your pick of overwater villas, garden villas &amp; beach villas, all designed with your comfort &amp; luxury in mind.</p>\n<p>One of the best highlights of Meeru Island Resort is its all-inclusive package, which includes all meals, drinks, &amp; various activities. This package allows you to indulge in the resort&#39;s culinary delights without worrying about the costs. You can also enjoy free access to non-motorized water sports, such as kayaking &amp; windsurfing. At the end of a sun-kissed, exciting day, the resort has a spa &amp; wellness centre offering various treatments for blissful relaxation.</p>\n<h4>ADD AN UNFORGETTABLE AFRICAN SAFARI</h4>\n<p>Now, you may wonder how you can combine your Maldives holiday with a safari in Africa. It&#39;s easier than you think. Many airlines offer direct flights from Male to various African destinations likeTanzania, Kenya, or South Africa, where you can experience a perfect safari adventure.</p>\n<p>Tanzania is famous for the Serengeti National Park, which is home to the world-renowned &amp; exhilarating wildebeest migration.
