A Hollywood actress. And like many of those people, life turned out a little different…But ‘different’ is what I have learned to embrace. See, ‘different’ also means ‘out of the ordinary’ - &amp; this is exactly what I have found on my first-ever trip to another country.</p>\n<p>At the age of 19, I hopped on a plane, left my world &amp; my ways behind &amp; stepped into a different world where people spoke a different language, ate different food &amp; showed me that ‘different’ is pretty special.</p>\n<p>In that moment, I felt at home.</p>\n<p>It is those moments that I still seek (&amp; find) in Africa’s thrilling wildlife encounters, her natural beauty &amp; interesting people. And today, more than 20 years later I embrace ‘different’ in my travels. See, travel broadens our horizons, awakens the adventurer in us &amp; overwhelms us – all at the same time.</p>\n<p>A few years after my first plane ride, I met someone who shared the same healthy obsession with travel &amp; shortly after, we said “I do.” Together, we chase the next country, the next destination, the next adventure. So of course, it didn’t come as a surprise to us when our “double the fun” motto brought us twins. ‘Out of the ordinary’ – this is our lives. Today, the twins share our passion for travel &amp; by their 5th birthday, they have already been to 5 countries.</p>\n<p>As a family, we continue to share our love for travel, because as Ibn Battuta said “Traveling – it leaves you speechless, then turns you into a storyteller.”</p>\n<p>Like many people, I knew what I wanted to do with my life when I was just 10 years old…To make it extraordinary!</p>\n<h1></h1>\n<h4>Liselle Raath</h4>\n<p>CEO</p>\n<h3>Random Facts About Me</h3>\n<h4>PASSIONS &amp; INTERESTS</h4>\n<p>People &amp; living out of a suitcase.</p>\n<h4>TRAVEL ESSENTIAL</h4>\n<p>My camera.</p>\n<h4>BUSH OR BEACH?</h4>\n<p>Beach in summer, bush in winter.</p>\n<h4>MUST EAT SAFARI FOOD</h4>\n<p>All of it.</p>\n<h4>FUNNIEST TRAVEL STORY</h4>\n<p>That day a hippo blocked the entrance to my chalet door…</p>\n<h4>FAVOURITE SAFARI ACTIVITY</h4>\n<p>Where there is action!
