Daytime temperatures are mostly mild and balmy, though evenings and early mornings are cold.  What is more, generally clear skies at night mean excellent stargazing.<br>Spring is from September to November when the weather is similar to that of autumn (March to May), except that the days start to get longer &amp; the temperatures warmer as summer approaches. This is an ideal time for game-viewing, as many antelope have their young and the rains return.<br>Summer in the Karoo can be very hot, with temperatures reaching over 35ºC.  The height of summer is the period December to February.  Expect hot sunny days with the occasional afternoon thunderstorm, which makes for stunning light &amp; great photographic opportunities.<br>Since the Karoo is a semi-arid area, the temperature drops off significantly once the sun goes down, so we recommend a fleece &amp;light jacket once dusk has fallen &amp; for night drives.<br>Summer is the best time of year to experience The Samara Milky Way Star Bed.</p>\n","images":["optimized-images/safaris/south-africa/eastern-cape/samara-game-reserve/1samara-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/south-africa/eastern-cape/samara-game-reserve/2samara-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/south-africa/eastern-cape/samara-game-reserve/3samara-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/south-africa/eastern-cape/samara-game-reserve/4samara-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/south-africa/eastern-cape/samara-game-reserve/5samara-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/south-africa/eastern-cape/samara-game-reserve/6samara-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/south-africa/eastern-cape/samara-game-reserve/7samara-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/south-africa/eastern-cape/samara-game-reserve/8samara-large.webp"],"subfolders":[{"title":"Samara Karoo Lodge","description":"The award-winning Samara Private Game Reserve is nestled between an amphitheatre of mountains in South Africa’s gorgeous Eastern Cape region.
