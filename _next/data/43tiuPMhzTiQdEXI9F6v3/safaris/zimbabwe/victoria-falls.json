Guests can also easily combine a Victoria Falls adventure with a safari to Hwange, Mana Pools, or Botswana for a well-rounded African holiday.</p>\n<h4>Activities</h4>\n<p>Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe is also known as Africa’s adventure capital and offers something for every type of traveler. Highlights include guided tours to the majestic Victoria Falls, scenic helicopter flights, sunset boat cruises on the Zambezi River, and a variety of adrenaline-pumping activities such as river rafting, bungee jumping, micro-lighting, and canoeing.<br>For families, there are fun-filled activities, including family-friendly adventures like elephant-back safaris, which are always a favorite among little adventurers.<br>If you are feeling adventurous, why not go for a swim at the edge of The Falls? (season dependent) Devil’s Pool at Livingstone Island has a good reputation &amp; never fails to impress thrill-seekers or Insta-lovers.</p>\n<h4>When to travel</h4>\n<p>The best time to visit the spectacular Victoria Falls is during the ‘High Water’ season, from February to July, directly after the region&#39;s summer rains. During this time, you&#39;ll witness the world&#39;s largest sheet of falling water flowing at its greatest volume.<br>‘Low Water’ runs between August &amp; January and is at its lowest between November &amp; early December. This is the time when there is very little spray, but river rafting &amp; swimming at Devil’s Pool are both wonderful activities to experience during the low season.<br>For an unforgettable Victoria Falls travel experience, consider exploring the wonders of Mosi-oa-Tunya with guided tours, thrilling helicopter flights, &amp; family-friendly adventures amidst the breathtaking beauty of this natural wonder.</p>\n","images":["optimized-images/safaris/zimbabwe/victoria-falls/1victoriafalls-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/zimbabwe/victoria-falls/2victoriafalls-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/zimbabwe/victoria-falls/3victoriafalls-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/zimbabwe/victoria-falls/4victoriafalls-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/zimbabwe/victoria-falls/5victoriafalls-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/zimbabwe/victoria-falls/6victoriafalls-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/zimbabwe/victoria-falls/7victoriafalls-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/zimbabwe/victoria-falls/8victoriafalls-large.webp"],"subfolders":[{"title":"Batonka Lodge","description":"The owner-run Batonka Lodge is set within easy walking distance to the majestic Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe.
