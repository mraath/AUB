The rooms were beautiful, with lovely large white towels, crisp, clean linen &amp; sublime views. We were offered various dinner options with complimentary reservations done on our behalf. The service was excellent. Depending on your family, we’d highly recommend the self -catering cottage, which provided us with ample space - especially on the few rainy days we had.<br>The highlight of each morning was breakfast. A delicious menu of which we sampled everything over the course of our holiday. Each member of the family had their favourite &amp; there was often a debate over who should be having the pancakes…again….<br>Being walking distance to the beach was also brilliant. We enjoyed some sundowner strolls. The lodge is also really close to the Robberg Nature Reserve walk, which was one of the favourite memories of our trip. Ensure you have enough sunscreen &amp; water. A truly remarkable walk of diversity; from sea cliffs, to dunes to beach.<br>We really felt looked after. It was a wonderful stay in a beautiful, quiet part of Plettenberg Bay. Highly recommended!<br>The Bilton Family</p>\n","images":["optimized-images/BLOG/our-clients-say/garden-route-getaway/1-Garden-Route-Getaway-large.webp","optimized-images/BLOG/our-clients-say/garden-route-getaway/2-Garden-Route-Getaway-large.webp","optimized-images/BLOG/our-clients-say/garden-route-getaway/3-Garden-Route-Getaway-large.webp","optimized-images/BLOG/our-clients-say/garden-route-getaway/4-Garden-Route-Getaway-large.webp","optimized-images/BLOG/our-clients-say/garden-route-getaway/5-Garden-Route-Getaway-large.webp","optimized-images/BLOG/our-clients-say/garden-route-getaway/6-Garden-Route-Getaway-large.webp","optimized-images/BLOG/our-clients-say/garden-route-getaway/7-Garden-Route-Getaway-large.webp","optimized-images/BLOG/our-clients-say/garden-route-getaway/8-Garden-Route-Getaway-large.webp"],"subfolders":[{"title":"Big 5 Bucket List","description":"We had a fantastic trip!!

Her recommendation did not disappoint.  We had an absolute blast at Cederberg Ridge Wilderness Lodge, being treated as royalty from the moment we arrived.  We had the peacefulness of a fireplace in our suite and sipping on local tea from the area.

In speaking with and comparing experiences with other travelers who were using some of the larger companies, we felt that we received a personalized &amp; top service from her. From the moment our itinerary was arranged to how she assisted us in finding substitute accommodations so quickly after a natural disaster. We were truly blown away by Lion Sands Ivory Lodge and also recognize that we likely received such a generous upgrade because of her local relationships.

Arathusa Safari Lodge was brilliant - especially with the waterhole full! We saw wild dogs, leopards & a cub as well as many lions & plenty of other wildlife.
