Exceptional animal encounters can be expected in this wild slice of Africa. The reserve is home to large numbers of lion prides, huge herds of elephants &amp;amp buffaloes, as well as leopard, hyena &amp;amp a variety of other animals.</p>\n<h4>Activities</h4>\n<p>North Luangwa is renowned for its world-class walking safaris &amp;amp this is one of the main reasons why travellers choose this part of Zambia for their safari holiday. Expert guides – some of the best on the continent – will share their passion &amp;amp knowledge of the bush as you explore the deepest, most remote corners of Africa on foot.<br>Some camps also offer open 4x4 game drives – a thrilling experience that will take you closer to some of Africa’s more dangerous predators.</p>\n<h4>When to travel</h4>\n<p>The best time to travel to North Luangwa National Park is during the dry season, which is from June to October. During this time, the grass is low &amp;amp animals are easy to find.<br>Note that much of North Luangwa National Park gets flooded during the wet summer season (from November to April), so all camps are closed during this time &amp;amp reopen after the rains have ended in April.<br>During May, it rains less, but there is still a lot of water around, so it is best to visit from June to October.</p>\n","images":["optimized-images/safaris/zambia/north-luangwa-national-park/1northluangwa-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/zambia/north-luangwa-national-park/2northluangwa-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/zambia/north-luangwa-national-park/3northluangwa-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/zambia/north-luangwa-national-park/4northluangwa-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/zambia/north-luangwa-national-park/5northluangwa-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/zambia/north-luangwa-national-park/6northluangwa-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/zambia/north-luangwa-national-park/7northluangwa-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/zambia/north-luangwa-national-park/8northluangwa-large.webp"],"subfolders":[{"title":"Mwaleshi Camp","description":"North Luangwa National Park is Africa’s best-kept secret.
