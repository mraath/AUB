A visit to the scenic Wine Route will leave you in awe.</li>\n<li>Maldives<br>The Maldives is comprised of 1,190 coral islands, of which 200 are inhabited &amp; only 98 are tourist resorts.

This untouched stretch of coastline is home to spectacular scenery that includes sweeping vistas of desert, ocean &amp; sky.  </li>\n<li>Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe<br>No one has ever wondered why Victoria Falls is listed as one of the only Seven Natural Wonders of the World.  The local people call it Mosi-oa-Tunya, “The smoke that thunders,” because something magnificent happens when the river is high &amp; the spray towers in the air while water gushes down like falling thunder.  Visitors travel from all around the globe to catch a glimpse of this spectacular sighting.</li>\n<li>Cape Town, South Africa<br>Nestled between the Indian &amp; Atlantic Oceans with iconic Table Mountain as backdrop, lies one of the world’s most vibrant &amp; breathtaking cities.

Talk about soaking up the scenery?  This will do it!</li>\n<li>Lake Malawi<br>When you stare out over the palm-fringed sandy beach with crystal-clear water, it is easy to think you are on an oceanic tropical island rather than the shores of Lake Malawi – one of the world’s largest freshwater lakes.  </li>\n<li>Panorama Route, South Africa<br>The Panorama Route is one of South Africa’s hidden gems &amp; a destination that you should not travel to without a camera!
