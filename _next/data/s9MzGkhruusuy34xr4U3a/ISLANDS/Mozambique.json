Surrounded by crystal clear water, Mozambique offers beach lovers the chance to experience excellent diving, snorkelling &amp; a host of other water &amp; land-based beach activities.<br>Not only will visitors experience world-class cuisine &amp; exceptional service, but some lodges even offer private butlers that will make sure you are treated like royalty. No demand is too great – be that arranging a romantic, private dinner on the beach, creating a bespoke cocktail or assisting you to book activities of your choice.<br>Mainland lodges are dotted along the coast in Pemba, Vilanculos &amp; Inhambane – but the highlight of a Mozambique holiday is – most definitely – staying on a secluded island in the Bazaruto Archipelago or the Quirimbas Archipelago - these are definitely rated as the best beaches in Mozambique!<br>These island retreats offer only the best in barefoot luxury &amp; exclusivity along with the breathtaking coastal beauty of Mozambique. Some lodges are situated on their very own private island, which means that the only other people you will encounter are the ones staying at the same lodge!<br>Days are often spent sunbathing, relaxing by the pool, or exploring the ocean’s beautiful marine life. Food-lovers will be happy to know that excellent dining can be expected in Mozambique. Dinners normally consist of fresh seafood, served in a relaxed beachside setting.</p>\n<h4>Stay</h4>\n<p>Since Mozambique is predominantly a beach destination, luxurious chalets or villas are situated right on the beach, boasting breathtaking views of the ocean. What is better than waking up to the sound of crashing waves or sipping a cocktail while watching the sunset?<br>Some villas have private plunge pools, others have outdoor showers – but most enjoy beautiful ocean views – the ideal place to unwind, especially post-safari.</p>\n<h4>When to travel</h4>\n<p>The best time to visit Mozambique is between May &amp; November in the dry winter season, with often perfect tropical weather: clear skies, plenty of sunshine &amp; almost no rain. December to April is the wet summer season, although it generally rains in brief but vigorous downpours after which the sun comes out again. Avoid southern Mozambique, including the Bazaruto Archipelago in January &amp; February during cyclone season.</p>\n","images":["optimized-images/ISLANDS/Mozambique/1Mozambique-large.webp","optimized-images/ISLANDS/Mozambique/2Mozambique-large.webp","optimized-images/ISLANDS/Mozambique/3Mozambique-large.webp","optimized-images/ISLANDS/Mozambique/4Mozambique-large.webp","optimized-images/ISLANDS/Mozambique/5Mozambique-large.webp","optimized-images/ISLANDS/Mozambique/6Mozambique-large.webp","optimized-images/ISLANDS/Mozambique/7Mozambique-large.webp","optimized-images/ISLANDS/Mozambique/8Mozambique-large.webp"],"subfolders":[{"title":"Anantara Bazaruto Island Resort & Spa","description":"Anantara Bazaruto Island Resort &amp; Spa is set on the beautiful Bazaruto Island in the Bazaruto Archipelago, off the coast of Mozambique.
