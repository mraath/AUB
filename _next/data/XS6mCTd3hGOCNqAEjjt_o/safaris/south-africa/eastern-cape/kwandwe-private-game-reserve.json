Other exciting activities include bird watching, fishing, picnics, rock art expeditions &amp; cultural tours.<br>Game drives include morning &amp; night drives where guests will search for nocturnal animals with spotlight – quite the adventure!<br>Some family-friendly lodges also offer Kids Clubs where the little ones will be entertained with a wide selection of fun-filled games, crafts &amp; safari activities.</p>\n<h4>When to travel</h4>\n<p>Kwandwe’s wildlife viewing is favourable all year but is marginally best in the driest months of the year (June through September).<br>This is during the winter season, so it can become very cold at times.  It is important to prepare for this with warm clothing, which is particularly important for evening &amp; morning game drives in open vehicles.<br>The warmer summer months (October to April) are more pleasant.</p>\n","images":["optimized-images/safaris/south-africa/eastern-cape/kwandwe-private-game-reserve/1kwandwe-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/south-africa/eastern-cape/kwandwe-private-game-reserve/2kwandwe-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/south-africa/eastern-cape/kwandwe-private-game-reserve/3kwandwe-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/south-africa/eastern-cape/kwandwe-private-game-reserve/4kwandwe-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/south-africa/eastern-cape/kwandwe-private-game-reserve/5kwandwe-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/south-africa/eastern-cape/kwandwe-private-game-reserve/6kwandwe-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/south-africa/eastern-cape/kwandwe-private-game-reserve/7kwandwe-1-large.webp","optimized-images/safaris/south-africa/eastern-cape/kwandwe-private-game-reserve/8kwandwe-large.webp"],"subfolders":[{"title":"Kwandwe Ecca Lodge","description":"The world-class Kwandwe Private Game Reserve is nestled in the heart of South Africa’s unspoilt Eastern Cape Province in a malaria-free private wilderness &amp; is home to Kwandwe Ecca Lodge.
