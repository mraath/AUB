Animals are easier to spot because the dry weather thins the bush &amp; wildlife concentrates around the Zambezi River &amp; the pools on its floodplains.<br>During the rainy season from late November to April, a completely different park emerges from that of the dry season. Parched savannahs turn into lush fields with an abundance of grazing. Many animals disperse inland &amp; game viewing becomes limited, although resident animals do remain. During the green season, newly born animals can be seen &amp; the birdlife is prolific.<br>Note that access by road is often limited between December &amp; March.</p>\n","images":["/AUB/optimized-images/safaris/zimbabwe/mana-pools-national-park/1manapools-large.webp","/AUB/optimized-images/safaris/zimbabwe/mana-pools-national-park/2manapools-large.webp","/AUB/optimized-images/safaris/zimbabwe/mana-pools-national-park/3manapools-large.webp","/AUB/optimized-images/safaris/zimbabwe/mana-pools-national-park/4manapools-large.webp","/AUB/optimized-images/safaris/zimbabwe/mana-pools-national-park/5manapools-large.webp","/AUB/optimized-images/safaris/zimbabwe/mana-pools-national-park/6manapools-large.webp","/AUB/optimized-images/safaris/zimbabwe/mana-pools-national-park/7manapools-large.webp","/AUB/optimized-images/safaris/zimbabwe/mana-pools-national-park/8manapools-large.webp"],"subfolders":[{"title":"Chikwenya Camp","description":"The seasonal Chikweyna Camp (open April to November) enjoys an idyllic location in an exclusive-use area in one of Zimbabwe’s prime wildlife regions:  Mana Pools National Park.
