The Garden Route with its breathtaking scenery &amp;amp; interesting coastal towns should also be added to a longer Cape Town stay.

Within only a 60-minute drive from vibrant Cape Town, you reach one of the most breathtaking regions in South Africa where Alpine-style views, art galleries &amp;amp; quaint side-walk cafes are seen from almost every street.
The Cape Winelands generally refers to the 3 most popular wine-growing regions surrounding Cape Town: Franschhoek, Stellenbosch &amp;amp; Paarl, each countryside setting as beautiful as the next.
Franschhoek is South Africa’s gourmet capital, so guests here can take their pick from a wide selection of award-winning restaurants &amp;amp; wine &amp;amp; gastronomy experiences. The oak tree-lined streets of Stellenbosch are dotted with art galleries, quaint coffee shops, boutiques &amp;amp; side-walk cafes while the quiet town of Paarl provides a relaxing, off-the-beaten-track Winelands experience.
Explore the Wine Route, South Africa &amp;amp; its variety of accommodation options that suit every type of traveller – from luxurious manor houses &amp;amp; secluded boutique hotels to farm-style suites &amp;amp; family-friendly villas.

Foodies &amp;amp; wine lovers should – most definitely – add the Winelands to their bucket list! But this breathtaking region offers so much more than just food &amp;amp; wine.
Guests can enjoy a long list of activities, including mountain biking, quad biking, hiking &amp;amp; horse-riding. Other attractions include art galleries, museums, wellness spas &amp;amp; shopping.
Families will be spoilt for choice in the Winelands. Fun family-friendly activities include animal encounters, grape juice &amp;amp; chocolate tastings, wine farm picnics, strawberry picking, acrobranching (treetop obstacle courses) &amp;amp; even eco-friendly, non-motorized scooter rides through the vineyards – great fun for the whole family. Some wine farms also offer authentic outdoor farm experiences specifically designed for the little ones.

The best time to visit the Winelands is between October &amp;amp; April when days are warm, dry &amp;amp; sunny. Winter is between June &amp;amp; August, but foodies can still enjoy rainy days next to a cosy fire.</span></p><div class="Cards_fadeOut__iJbVq"></div></div></a></div><div class="Cards_card__wYVf4 Cards_coverimgmain__65A74"><a class="Cards_link__2bKVP" href="/cities/whale-route"><div class="Cards_cardImage__RUe2O Cards_coverimg__j8N2f"><img alt="WHALE ROUTE" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" class="Cards_img__TlfQc" style="position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;object-fit:cover;color:transparent" src="/optimized-images/default.webp"/></div><div class="Cards_h2class__syS9G">WHALE ROUTE</div><div class="Cards_descr__gRO23"><p><span>The scenic Whale Route is the Overberg region’s Indian Ocean coastline - &amp;amp; also considered one of the most breathtaking drives in the country.
The Whale Route’s claim to fame is that it offers the best land-based whale watching in the world!
Each year between July &amp;amp; November (the BEST time to do the Whale Trail), Southern Right whales &amp;amp; Humpback whales migrate here to calve &amp;amp; mate, so visitors can marvel at these gentle giants from one of the walking paths overlooking the ocean or from the comfort of a boat.
For the ultimate whale watching experience, avid photographers can also take to the skies for a spectacular bird’s eye view of the whales while capturing an incredible shot of mothers with their newborn calves, or large mating groups.
But whales are not the only reason to visit. The Whale Route has so much to offer – from majestic mountains &amp;amp; beautiful beaches to nature reserves &amp;amp; charming seaside towns.
At the heart of the Whale Route, you will find Hermanus - an old fishing village that has become a bustling town &amp;amp; world-famed whale watching base.
For a more exclusive whale watching experience away from crowds, head further up the coast to De Kelders.
Thrill-seekers can head to Gansbaai for shark-cage diving while Cape Agulhas - the southernmost tip of Africa, is also worth exploring (It’s not just whale watching on the Whale Route!). 
Don’t miss Grootbos Nature Reserve &amp;amp; De Hoop Nature Reserve &amp;amp; the charming fishing village of Arniston.
Located only a 2-hour scenic drive from Cape Town, guests can quickly switch from ‘vibrant city’ to ‘relaxing seaside living.’

Exciting water-based activities include whale watching by boat, shark cage diving, kayaking, surfing, stand-up paddleboarding &amp;amp; swimming.
Some land-based activities to choose from, include whale watching from one of the many viewpoints, hiking, golf, quad biking, horse-riding, bird watching &amp;amp; shopping.

The best time to explore the Whale Route in South Africa is in Winter &amp;amp; Spring from July to November, so if whales are what you want to tick off your list, make sure to travel during these months. Summer is between December &amp;amp; April when days are sunny &amp;amp; warm – the ideal time for a beach holiday.</span></p><div class="Cards_fadeOut__iJbVq"></div></div></a></div><div class="Cards_card__wYVf4 Cards_coverimgmain__65A74"><a class="Cards_link__2bKVP" href="/cities/garden-route"><div class="Cards_cardImage__RUe2O Cards_coverimg__j8N2f"><img alt="GARDEN ROUTE" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" class="Cards_img__TlfQc" style="position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;object-fit:cover;color:transparent" src="/optimized-images/default.webp"/></div><div class="Cards_h2class__syS9G">GARDEN ROUTE</div><div class="Cards_descr__gRO23"><p><span>South Africa’s world-renowned Garden Route is a sunny stretch of coastline that lies just a few hours’ drive from the vibrant city of Cape Town, featuring a wonderful blend of beautiful beaches, lush forests, tranquil lagoons &amp;amp; bustling seaside towns.

The short driving distances between the charming seaside towns that make up the Garden Route – of which Knysna, Plettenberg Bay &amp;amp; Port Elizabeth are the most popular – each offer something special.
Wildlife seekers should add a Big 5 safari to their Garden Route holiday. The nearby Eastern Cape offers plenty of wonderful family-friendly options as well as luxurious lodges for couples or honeymooners.

The Garden Route has an all-year-round temperate climate that is perfectly suited to an outdoor lifestyle. The best time to travel is in summer (between November &amp;amp; April) when temperatures are at their highest.

A defining feature of the Eastern Cape is its collection of game reserves, many of which are home to the legendary Big 5: lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo, &amp;amp rhino. What sets this region apart is its status as a malaria-free haven, making it an excellent choice for families seeking child-friendly activities to keep the young ones engaged.
Among the most sought-after private reserves in the Eastern Cape, you&#x27;ll find:
Addo Elephant National Park: This park is most renowned for its extensive herds of elephants, truly a sight to behold.
Shamwari: Noted for its remarkable conservation initiatives, Shamwari is committed to protecting &amp;amp preserving the region&#x27;s wildlife &amp;amp natural beauty.
Kwandwe: Featuring four award-winning lodges, Kwandwe offers an unforgettable safari experience amid pristine wilderness.

The Eastern Cape offers a diverse range of activities for travelers to enjoy. While on safari, guests can embark on open 4x4 game drives in pursuit of iconic wildlife. Expert-led walking safaris provide an intimate look at the flora &amp;amp fauna of the region, while tranquil river cruises &amp;amp thrilling horseback expeditions offer unique ways to explore this captivating landscape.
For families, many lodges in the Eastern Cape have established Kids Clubs, which organize exciting activities such as scavenger hunts, arts &amp;amp crafts sessions, educational games, movie nights, &amp;amp even do-it-yourself pizza evenings.

Wildlife viewing in the Eastern Cape is rewarding throughout the year. Thanks to the semi-arid climate of the region, animals are naturally drawn to water sources year-round. However, wildlife activity tends to be marginally more pronounced during the driest months, which span from June through September.
During these months, the nights can become quite chilly, so it&#x27;s advisable to pack warm clothing for game drives conducted in open vehicles.</span></p><div class="Cards_fadeOut__iJbVq"></div></div></a></div><div class="Cards_card__wYVf4 Cards_coverimgmain__65A74"><a class="Cards_link__2bKVP" href="/safaris/south-africa/madikwe-game-reserve"><div class="Cards_cardImage__RUe2O Cards_coverimg__j8N2f"><img alt="MADIKWE GAME RESERVE" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" class="Cards_img__TlfQc" style="position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;object-fit:cover;color:transparent" src="/optimized-images/default.webp"/></div><div class="Cards_h2class__syS9G">MADIKWE GAME RESERVE</div><div class="Cards_descr__gRO23"><p><span>Madikwe Private Game Reserve, sprawling across 75,000 hectares, stands as one of South Africa&#x27;s most expansive Big 5 reserves.

For wildlife enthusiasts, Madikwe is nothing short of a paradise. It&#x27;s undeniably one of the finest locations in the country to witness the rare &amp;amp endangered African wild dog, a captivating sight that draws safari enthusiasts from across the globe.
What sets Madikwe apart is its private ownership &amp;amp management, which means day visitors are not permitted. This exclusivity ensures an intimate &amp;amp private safari experience, as it should be. The reserve allows off-road driving &amp;amp night drives, providing guests with extraordinary opportunities for up-close wildlife encounters &amp;amp exceptional photographic moments.
Furthermore, Madikwe boasts a malaria-free status, making it an ideal choice for families with young children. The reserve offers an extensive selection of family-friendly safari lodges that provide exciting children&#x27;s activities, dedicated meals, &amp;amp even babysitting services.

The dry season, spanning from May to September, is the prime period for wildlife viewing throughout the region. During this time, the vegetation thins out, making it easier to spot wildlife. The months of April and October are considered shoulder seasons &amp;amp also offer excellent game viewing opportunities.
In contrast, the rainy season from December to March transforms Madikwe into a lush &amp;amp vibrant paradise. This period showcases sensational birding opportunities &amp;amp brings forth a wave of baby animals, a favored prey for the many predators that roam Madikwe.</span></p><div class="Cards_fadeOut__iJbVq"></div></div></a></div><div class="Cards_card__wYVf4 Cards_coverimgmain__65A74"><a class="Cards_link__2bKVP" href="/safaris/south-africa/pilanesberg-national-park"><div class="Cards_cardImage__RUe2O Cards_coverimg__j8N2f"><img alt="PILANESBERG NATIONAL PARK" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" class="Cards_img__TlfQc" style="position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;object-fit:cover;color:transparent" src="/optimized-images/default.webp"/></div><div class="Cards_h2class__syS9G">PILANESBERG NATIONAL PARK</div><div class="Cards_descr__gRO23"><p><span>Only a stone’s throw from the famous Sun City resort &amp;amp a 2-hour drive from Johannesburg, the easily accessible Pilanesberg National Park offers its guests an abundance of wildlife &amp;amp a wide selection of activities for the whole family.

The park is set within the slopes of an extinct volcanic crater &amp;amp centred around a teeming lake, so visitors can enjoy spectacular views over striking landscapes as well as amazing photographic opportunities in one of South Africa’s most breathtaking reserves.

Visitors get the opportunity to observe Africa’s magnificent creatures in the wild with twice-daily open 4x4 game drives &amp;amp nature walks with expert-led guides.
Game drives take place twice daily - once in the morning &amp;amp once in the afternoon &amp;amp evening so that guests have an opportunity to search for nocturnal animals with a spotlight.
You can’t visit Pilanesberg without taking a scenic hot air balloon flight over the reserve! This is - most definitely - one for the bucket list.
Family-friendly lodges have a host of fun-filled activities for the little ones, including children’s meals &amp;amp babysitting services.

The best time to visit the Pilanesberg is from July to October (during late winter, spring or early summer). The reason for this is that animals take time to feed longer in the winter months, as there is less nutrition.
The mating season which occurs from late February onwards is something worth seeing, as well. Rainfall is most common in the warm, summer months, between October &amp;amp March.</span></p><div class="Cards_fadeOut__iJbVq"></div></div></a></div><div class="Cards_card__wYVf4 Cards_coverimgmain__65A74"><a class="Cards_link__2bKVP" href="/safaris/south-africa/welgevonden-game-reserve"><div class="Cards_cardImage__RUe2O Cards_coverimg__j8N2f"><img alt="WELGEVONDEN GAME RESERVE" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" class="Cards_img__TlfQc" style="position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;object-fit:cover;color:transparent" src="/optimized-images/default.webp"/></div><div class="Cards_h2class__syS9G">WELGEVONDEN GAME RESERVE</div><div class="Cards_descr__gRO23"><p><span>Welgevonden Game Reserve is a 36,000-hectare private game reserve in the Waterberg District of the Limpopo Province of South Africa.

Welgevonden offers an exclusive, intimate safari experience, with only a limited number of guests having access to the reserve at any one time. Because of this vehicle restriction &amp;amp the fact that the animals have never been hunted means that they remain largely unphased by human proximity, allowing for particularly close-up encounters.

At Welgevonden, guests will have the opportunity to see over 65 mammal species – including the coveted Big 5 as well as over 300 species of bird!
Visitors can observe Africa’s magnificent creatures in the wild with twice-daily open 4x4 game drives &amp;amp nature walks with expert-led guides. Game drives take place twice daily - once in the morning &amp;amp once in the afternoon &amp;amp evening so that guests have an opportunity to search for nocturnal animals with a spotlight.

Welgevonden’s climate is generally described as warm and temperate, with three distinct seasons.
The dryer winter months (May – July) are often considered the best time of year for big game viewing as the grass &amp;amp savanna are shorter and less dense than in the wetter months, making the animals easier to spot.
From August to October, the bush remains predominantly dry, though you will get the occasional thunderstorm rolling in across the plains. The wet season is from November to April.

Depending on your family, we’d highly recommend the self -catering cottage, which provided us with ample space - especially on the few rainy days we had. 
The highlight of each morning was breakfast. A delicious menu of which we sampled everything over the course of our holiday. Each member of the family had their favourite &amp; there was often a debate over who should be having the pancakes…again….
Being walking distance to the beach was also brilliant. We enjoyed some sundowner strolls. The lodge is also really close to the Robberg Nature Reserve walk, which was one of the favourite memories of our trip. Ensure you have enough sunscreen &amp; water. A truly remarkable walk of diversity; from sea cliffs, to dunes to beach.
