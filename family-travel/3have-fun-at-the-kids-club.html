be fun!  But often ‘fun for Mum &amp; Dad’, doesn’t necessarily mean ‘fun for the kids!’ (&amp; vice versa) But when your family travels to Africa, we’ll make sure that ‘fun’ is indeed for the whole family.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to ensure that everyone is happy is to pick family-friendly lodges with Kids Clubs. That way, the little ones can play at their heart’s content, learn about Africa &amp; enjoy a variety of fun activities while Mum &amp; Dad enjoy an afternoon siesta.   </p>
<p>There are wonderful Kids Clubs throughout Africa, but we’ll share some of our favourites with you – so start packing &amp; get ready for oodles of family fun!</p>
<h4>1. Mauritius</h4>
<p>Yes, Mauritius is Number 1 on our list, because most resorts on this beautiful island boast fantastic Kids (&amp; Teens) Clubs that will keep your kids busy for days!  Mauritius resorts offer an impressive amount of age-appropriate land &amp; water activities – with dedicated adult supervision, of course.  So, Mum &amp; Dad can relax by the pool, enjoy water sports or take a siesta as kids craft &amp; play to their hearts’ content.</p>
<h4>2. Madikwe Safari Lodge, Madikwe Game Reserve – South Africa</h4>

<h4>3. Londolozi Varty Camp, Sabi Sand Reserve – South Africa</h4>
<p>Londolozi stands out above the rest when it comes to a child’s tailored safari experience.  Recognising that each child is unique, an assessment is done upon arrival by a ranger &amp; qualified facilitator who then custom design a fun-filled safari itinerary for each child.  Private game drives mean that your family can come &amp; go, stop, touch, feel &amp; smell at your own pace.  Back at camp, kids will also enjoy archery, tree climbing, fishing, movie nights, pizza making, sling-shot competitions, water-based games, Masterchef cook-offs, arts &amp; crafts, &amp; photography lessons.</p>
<h4>4. Kwandwe Ecca Lodge, Kwandwe Private Game Reserve – South Africa</h4>
