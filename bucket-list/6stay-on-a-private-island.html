Romantic island activities include kayaking together to a nearby island or enjoying couple’s massages in the spa’s massage pavilion.

Inspired by Creole-Seychellois heritage, the 10 one-bedroom private pool villas are scattered along the beach.
Each villa features an open-air bathroom &amp;amp; a spacious indoor area with floor-to-ceiling windows that open to an outdoor deck with an infinity pool.  
At the main lodge area, you will find an inviting restaurant &amp;amp; bar overlooking the swimming pool &amp;amp; deck area.  Walkways connect each villa to the beaches &amp;amp; other lodge facilities.  
At the centre of the island, the spa is perched on a hill offering tranquil views over the ocean.  Here, guests can either opt for the private therapy room or enjoy the couples’ treatment room with a  private steam room, outdoor bathtub &amp;amp; viewing deck.
Other facilities include a gym, relaxation pavilion &amp;amp; a helipad situated on the jetty.

Activities at Enchanted Island Resort include diving, snorkelling, fishing, kayaking &amp;amp; exciting boating excursions to nearby islands.
Guests can also enjoy relaxing treatments at the hilltop spa, take a dip in their private pool or work up a sweat in the gym.</span></p><div class="Cards_fadeOut__iJbVq"></div></div></a></div><div class="Cards_card__wYVf4 Cards_coverimgmain__65A74"><a class="Cards_link__2bKVP" href="/blog/all-things-africa/magical-maldives"><div class="Cards_cardImage__RUe2O Cards_coverimg__j8N2f"><img alt="Magical Maldives" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" class="Cards_img__TlfQc" style="position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;object-fit:cover;color:transparent" src="/optimized-images/default.webp"/></div><div class="Cards_h2class__syS9G">Magical Maldives</div><div class="Cards_descr__gRO23"><p><span>Discover paradise at Meeru Island Resort in the Maldives.
