like visiting Paris without catching a glimpse of the Eiffel Tower!  </p>
<p>The term ‘Big 5’ was coined by big-game hunters of the past &amp; refers to the 5 most difficult animals in Africa to hunt on foot - but is now widely used in the safari industry as some of the most interesting animals to see on a photographic safari.</p>
<p>Lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo &amp; rhino have become ‘celebrities of the bush’ &amp; one of the main reasons an African safari should be on everyone’s bucket list.</p>
<p>There are many places in Africa where you can see the Big 5, so journey with us as we share the best of the best.</p>
<h4>1. South Africa</h4>
<p>South Africa is the king of the jungle when it comes to Big 5 game reserves, &amp; this beautiful country offers something for everyone.  The best place to see the Big 5 is in Kruger’s Private Game Reserves.  Families who are looking for a malaria-free holiday should opt for Madikwe Game Reserve or one of the reserves in the Eastern Cape as these destinations offer a variety of family-friendly lodges &amp; camps.</p>
<h4>2. Botswana</h4>
<p>For an authentic &amp; wild safari experience, you should hop on a small plane &amp; fly to the world-famous Okavango Delta, the game-packed Moremi Game Reserve &amp; the iconic Chobe National Park as these areas all offer superb Big 5 wildlife viewing.</p>
<h4>3. Namibia</h4>
<p>Etosha National Park is Nambia’s cherry on top when it comes to Big 5 game viewing.  The park is famous for its numerous waterholes, so you’ll have ample opportunity to witness animals make their way to the water to drink, splash &amp; play.</p>
<h4>4. Tanzania</h4>
<p>Most visitors to Tanzania want to see the Great Wildebeest Migration, one of Earth’s greatest wildlife spectacles.  But the country also offers superb Big 5 wildlife viewing year-round.  The best places to see the Big 5 is in the game-packed Serengeti National Park &amp; the beautiful Ngorongoro Crater.</p>
<h4>5. Kenya</h4>
<p>The crème de la crème of Kenya is the Masai Mara, a magnet for travellers who want to experience the Great Wildebeest Migration in season.  The Mara is also home to the famous Big 5, so guests can tick off both in one holiday.</p>
<h4>6. Zimbabwe</h4>
<p>Most travellers who want to experience a classic Big 5 safari, also want to witness one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World:  the majestic Victoria Falls.  The Falls can be seen from both Zimbabwe &amp; Zambia’s sides &amp; can easily be combined with a safari to Zimbabwe’s Big 5 regions:  Hwange National Park &amp; Mana Pools National Park.</p>
<h4>7.  Zambia</h4>
<p>Although Zambia is technically a Big 5 country, rhino is rare &amp; can only be seen in Victoria Falls’ Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park &amp; in North Luangwa National Park.  Lion, elephant &amp; buffalo are common across multiple parks while Kafue, South Luangwa &amp; Lower Zambezi are well-known for leopards.</p>

It consistently earns its place among the best of Africa&#x27;s parks &amp;amp reserves.
Spanning a vast expanse of land, Kruger National Park covers nearly 20,000 square kilometers, making it roughly the size of Israel or Wales. This immense territory extends across two of South Africa&#x27;s provinces &amp;amp teems with an abundance of wildlife, including the coveted Big 5 – lions, leopards, elephants, buffaloes, &amp;amp rhinos.
However, the park itself represents only one facet of the Greater Kruger region. Complementing Kruger National Park are the Kruger&#x27;s Private Reserves. While the park is managed by the government parastatal SANParks and is open to the public, the private reserves adjoin much of Kruger&#x27;s western, unfenced boundary &amp;amp are privately owned &amp;amp operated.
These conservation-minded private reserves include the Sabi Sand, Timbavati, Thornybush, Klaserie, Manyeleti, Kapama, Balule, &amp;amp the Kruger Concession, which lies within the park itself. These reserves are home to some of the biggest names in safari travel, offering the perfect fusion of exceptional wildlife viewing &amp;amp luxurious safari living.
Distinct from the National Park, the private reserves permit off-road driving &amp;amp exhilarating night drives. In these reserves, safari enthusiasts can anticipate remarkable, up-close wildlife encounters that make for indelible memories.

Visitors to the Greater Kruger region are privileged with the opportunity to witness Africa&#x27;s magnificent creatures in their untamed habitat. Twice-daily open 4x4 game drives, accompanied by expert-led guides, enable guests to marvel at the splendor of the African wilderness.
Game drives unfold twice daily, with morning &amp;amp afternoon/evening outings, ensuring ample chances to seek out the elusive nocturnal creatures with the help of a spotlight. Off-road driving ventures deep into the heart of the action, guaranteeing wildlife encounters of the highest calibre.

The winter season (May to September), known as the dry season, reigns as the best time for wildlife viewing in the region. During this period, the vegetation thins out, making wildlife spotting remarkably easy.
Shoulder months like April and October also offer favorable game viewing opportunities.

OCTOBER: In October, the best time for wildlife viewing is in the Masai Mara in Kenya. Opt to stay in one of the less-crowded private conservancies where off-road driving &amp; night drives are permitted.
NOVEMBER: Normally, the short rains begin in November - tempting the wildebeest to leave the dry Mara for the rejuvenated Serengeti. Generally, they can be seen in the Serengeti’s northeastern region where they may split into smaller groups before continuing their journey southward.
DECEMBER: In December, the herds move south towards fresh grazing &amp; cover the northern &amp; eastern Serengeti in preparation for another action-packed 3,000 km journey.</span></p><div class="Cards_fadeOut__iJbVq"></div></div></a></div><div class="Cards_card__wYVf4 Cards_coverimgmain__65A74"><a class="Cards_link__2bKVP" href="/safaris/tanzania/ngorongoro-crater"><div class="Cards_cardImage__RUe2O Cards_coverimg__j8N2f"><img alt="NGORONGORO CRATER" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" class="Cards_img__TlfQc" style="position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;object-fit:cover;color:transparent" src="/optimized-images/default.webp"/></div><div class="Cards_h2class__syS9G">NGORONGORO CRATER</div><div class="Cards_descr__gRO23"><p><span>Ngorongoro Crater, situated in northern Tanzania, is an ancient volcanic caldera known for providing some of East Africa&#x27;s easiest &amp;amp most rewarding game viewing experiences.

Luxurious lodges situated atop cliffs on the rim of Ngorongoro Crater provide some of the world&#x27;s most breathtaking views. Staying near the rim also has the added perk of being first in line for the descent to the crater floor each morning, allowing you to beat the crowds.
For travelers seeking more budget-friendly yet equally peaceful safari accommodations, the nearby town of Karatu, about 20 km south of the crater in the lush hills of the Karatu Highlands, offers excellent options. Many lodgings here are surrounded by working coffee plantations, offering a wide range of activities, similar to those at the crater rim.

The heart of the Masai Mara experience lies in open 4x4 game drives &amp;amp walking safaris guided by Maasai warriors. These game drives take you right into the heart of the action, ensuring intimate encounters with Africa&#x27;s wildlife. Expert local guides lead both morning &amp;amp afternoon game drives.

The Masai Mara offers superb year-round wildlife viewing, so there&#x27;s no single &#x27;best time to go&#x27; for general game viewing. High season (June to October) brings cooler, drier weather &amp;amp more crowds, while low season (November to March) offers warmer, wetter conditions &amp;amp fewer visitors. During the low season, there are more baby animals to see, &amp;amp birding is excellent.
However, the absolute best time to witness the world-famous Wildebeest Migration is usually between August &amp;amp November, depending on rainfall patterns. The Mara&#x27;s resident animals give birth between December &amp;amp January during calving season.

As a fly-in destination, Mana Pools can be easily reached from Victoria Falls or Hwange, so travellers can have a well-rounded Zimbabwe safari experience.

The Zambezi River makes it possible for guests to enjoy both land &amp; water-based safari activities in Mana Pools.
These include traditional open 4x4 game drives, as well as exclusive guided walks in Zimbabwe and river-based safaris which include a mix of kayaking, boating, fishing, &amp; wildlife fly camping safaris.

The best time for birdwatching and wildlife viewing in Mana Pools National Park is during the dry season, from June to October. Animals are easier to spot because the dry weather thins the bush &amp; wildlife concentrates around the Zambezi River &amp; the pools on its floodplains.
During the rainy season from late November to April, a completely different park emerges from that of the dry season. Parched savannahs turn into lush fields with an abundance of grazing. Many animals disperse inland &amp; game viewing becomes limited, although resident animals do remain. During the green season, newly born animals can be seen &amp; the birdlife is prolific.
Note that access by road is often limited between December &amp; March.</span></p><div class="Cards_fadeOut__iJbVq"></div></div></a></div><div class="Cards_card__wYVf4 Cards_coverimgmain__65A74"><a class="Cards_link__2bKVP" href="/safaris/zambia/north-luangwa-national-park"><div class="Cards_cardImage__RUe2O Cards_coverimg__j8N2f"><img alt="NORTH LUANGWA NATIONAL PARK" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" class="Cards_img__TlfQc" style="position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;object-fit:cover;color:transparent" src="/optimized-images/default.webp"/></div><div class="Cards_h2class__syS9G">NORTH LUANGWA NATIONAL PA...</div><div class="Cards_descr__gRO23"><p><span>Africa has a few well-kept secrets, &amp;amp Zambia’s North Luangwa National Park is one of them.
One of Africa’s wildest safari destinations, the park offers an off-the-beaten-track wildlife experience to safari-goers who are looking for ‘the real Africa.’
There are no permanent camps found in North Luangwa - only a handful of intimate, seasonal camps, a few roads &amp;amp a trickle of visitors, making this region one of the most untouched wildlife destinations in Africa.
The number of visitors should not fool you! Exceptional animal encounters can be expected in this wild slice of Africa. The reserve is home to large numbers of lion prides, huge herds of elephants &amp;amp buffaloes, as well as leopard, hyena &amp;amp a variety of other animals.

North Luangwa is renowned for its world-class walking safaris &amp;amp this is one of the main reasons why travellers choose this part of Zambia for their safari holiday. Expert guides – some of the best on the continent – will share their passion &amp;amp knowledge of the bush as you explore the deepest, most remote corners of Africa on foot.
Some camps also offer open 4x4 game drives – a thrilling experience that will take you closer to some of Africa’s more dangerous predators.

The best time to travel to North Luangwa National Park is during the dry season, which is from June to October. During this time, the grass is low &amp;amp animals are easy to find.
Note that much of North Luangwa National Park gets flooded during the wet summer season (from November to April), so all camps are closed during this time &amp;amp reopen after the rains have ended in April.
During May, it rains less, but there is still a lot of water around, so it is best to visit from June to October.</span></p><div class="Cards_fadeOut__iJbVq"></div></div></a></div><div class="Cards_card__wYVf4 Cards_coverimgmain__65A74"><a class="Cards_link__2bKVP" href="/blog/all-things-africa/okavango-delta-lodges"><div class="Cards_cardImage__RUe2O Cards_coverimg__j8N2f"><img alt="Okavango Delta Lodges" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" class="Cards_img__TlfQc" style="position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;object-fit:cover;color:transparent" src="/optimized-images/default.webp"/></div><div class="Cards_h2class__syS9G">Okavango Delta Lodges</div><div class="Cards_descr__gRO23"><p><span>Explore Botswana&#x27;s Luxury Safari Lodges in the Okavango Delta - An Oasis of Serenity.

Expert guides – some of the best on the continent – will share their passion \u0026amp knowledge of the bush as you explore the deepest, most remote corners of Africa on foot.\nSome camps also offer open 4x4 game drives – a thrilling experience that will take you closer to some of Africa’s more dangerous predators.\n\nThe best time to travel to North Luangwa National Park is during the dry season, which is from June to October. During this time, the grass is low \u0026amp animals are easy to find.\nNote that much of North Luangwa National Park gets flooded during the wet summer season (from November to April), so all camps are closed during this time \u0026amp reopen after the rains have ended in April.\nDuring May, it rains less, but there is still a lot of water around, so it is best to visit from June to October.","image":"optimized-images/default.webp","folderName":"safaris/zambia/north-luangwa-national-park","created":null},{"title":"Okavango Delta Lodges","description":"Explore Botswana's Luxury Safari Lodges in the Okavango Delta - An Oasis of Serenity.
