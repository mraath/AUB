(childhood) dreams a reality.  When we grow up, we sometimes forget that life is still full of fantasy, mystery &amp; fun.</p>
<p>Many safari lodges throughout Africa offer guests just that – a unique &amp; magical experience…&amp; what is more magical than spending a night in a treehouse under the stars?</p>
<p>Each treehouse is luxuriously set up for you, usually accompanied by a special dinner under the stars, a radio &amp; a starry sky as canopy.  Some treehouses are located in the middle of the bush (close enough to camp) while others come in the form of ‘star beds’ on your chalet’s open rooftop deck.</p>
<p>Step back with us into childhood &amp; see which treehouse stay you prefer. </p>
<p>(Please note that most treehouse stays are only available when booking a room at the lodge, in the event that you have to return to your room due to bad weather.)</p>
