Perhaps it is because we forget the rat race, the job, the responsibilities & the dog at home (of course you got a sitter), & we focus on the things that really matter.  People. \n\nYou’ll hear us talk about people often, because – if we are truly honest with ourselves – life revolves around doing things together.  Sure, travel is always fun, but sharing an adventure with someone is even better!",

    "description": "What is a bucket list? Simply put, it is a collection of dreams & aspirations that we would like to accomplish within our lifetime.\nIt is no surprise that when it comes to travel goals, Africa is usually on top of the list. Our beautiful continent dominates all bucket list destinations because of the spectacular memories & moments it promises!\nAfrica offers its visitors a variety of experiences, including action-packed wildlife encounters, spectacular scenery, pristine beaches & exciting activities.\nWe have compiled a list of our Top 6 bucket list travel experiences, so come & journey with us as we dive deeper into Africa’s most rewarding safari ‘must-do’s.’\nLooking for bucket list travel experiences? A safari should be Number 1 on everyone’s list. Africa offers superb Big 5 game viewing, close-up wildlife encounters & dramatic nature spectacles such as the Great Wildebeest Migration – a ‘not to be missed’ activity on the safari itinerary. Adding on Victoria Falls, one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World is a great idea.\nExperiencing the real Africa from the comfort of an open-air treehouse is quite the adventure & definitely an experience of a lifetime. Sleeping under a canopy of stars while listening to the sounds of the wild is what the African Bucket List is all about.\nThere are many ways to enjoy close-up wildlife encounters. Open 4x4 game drives & guided walking safaris will take guests straight into the action while relaxing mokoro or boating safaris are the perfect way to get closer to aquatic animals such as hippo, crocodile & birds.\nHot air balloon safaris allow guests to enjoy a bird’s eye view over the scenic landscape below. Flying over the red sand dunes of Sossusvlei or the game-packed plains of the Serengeti is an experience that should not be missed.\nWhat is more magical than spending time with endangered mountain gorillas in the lush forests of Rwanda or Uganda? Hiking through dense rainforests in search of wild, habituated gorillas & chimps is a life-changing experience, to say the least. Observing these amazing creatures in their natural habitat is one you will never forget.\nThe Indian Ocean is filled with secluded islands where absolute exclusivity is the aim. Most of these islands can only be accessed by helicopter, small plane or sea transfer – which means that you will experience only the best in barefoot luxury where beach villas, private pools & white, sandy beaches await.\n\nTick off the Big 5 (& see Vic Falls)\nSleep in a treehouse under the stars\nEnjoy a water-based safari\nFloat in a hot air balloon\nGo gorilla-trekking\nStay on a private island",

    "description": "TICK OFF THE BIG 5 \nComing to Africa without seeing the Big 5 is like visiting Paris without catching a glimpse of the Eiffel Tower!  \nThe term ‘Big 5’ was coined by big-game hunters of the past &amp; refers to the 5 most difficult animals in Africa to hunt on foot - but is now widely used in the safari industry as some of the most interesting animals to see on a photographic safari.\nLion, leopard, elephant, buffalo &amp; rhino have become ‘celebrities of the bush’ &amp; one of the main reasons an African safari should be on everyone’s bucket list.\nThere are many places in Africa where you can see the Big 5, so journey with us as we share the best of the best.\n1. South Africa\nSouth Africa is the king of the jungle when it comes to Big 5 game reserves, &amp; this beautiful country offers something for everyone.  The best place to see the Big 5 is in Kruger’s Private Game Reserves.  Families who are looking for a malaria-free holiday should opt for Madikwe Game Reserve or one of the reserves in the Eastern Cape as these destinations offer a variety of family-friendly lodges &amp; camps.\n2. Botswana\nFor an authentic &amp; wild safari experience, you should hop on a small plane &amp; fly to the world-famous Okavango Delta, the game-packed Moremi Game Reserve &amp; the iconic Chobe National Park as these areas all offer superb Big 5 wildlife viewing.\n3. Namibia\nEtosha National Park is Nambia’s cherry on top when it comes to Big 5 game viewing.  The park is famous for its numerous waterholes, so you’ll have ample opportunity to witness animals make their way to the water to drink, splash &amp; play.\n4. Tanzania\nMost visitors to Tanzania want to see the Great Wildebeest Migration, one of Earth’s greatest wildlife spectacles.  But the country also offers superb Big 5 wildlife viewing year-round.  The best places to see the Big 5 is in the game-packed Serengeti National Park &amp; the beautiful Ngorongoro Crater.  \n5. Kenya\nThe crème de la crème of Kenya is the Masai Mara, a magnet for travellers who want to experience the Great Wildebeest Migration in season.  The Mara is also home to the famous Big 5, so guests can tick off both in one holiday.\n6. Zimbabwe\nMost travellers who want to experience a classic Big 5 safari, also want to witness one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World:  the majestic Victoria Falls.  The Falls can be seen from both Zimbabwe &amp; Zambia’s sides &amp; can easily be combined with a safari to Zimbabwe’s Big 5 regions:  Hwange National Park &amp; Mana Pools National Park.\n7.  Zambia\nAlthough Zambia is technically a Big 5 country, rhino is rare &amp; can only be seen in Victoria Falls’ Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park &amp; in North Luangwa National Park.  Lion, elephant &amp; buffalo are common across multiple parks while Kafue, South Luangwa &amp; Lower Zambezi are well-known for leopards.",

When we grow up, we sometimes forget that life is still full of fantasy, mystery &amp; fun.\nMany safari lodges throughout Africa offer guests just that – a unique &amp; magical experience…&amp; what is more magical than spending a night in a treehouse under the stars?\nEach treehouse is luxuriously set up for you, usually accompanied by a special dinner under the stars, a radio &amp; a starry sky as canopy.  Some treehouses are located in the middle of the bush (close enough to camp) while others come in the form of ‘star beds’ on your chalet’s open rooftop deck.\nStep back with us into childhood &amp; see which treehouse stay you prefer. \n(Please note that most treehouse stays are only available when booking a room at the lodge, in the event that you have to return to your room due to bad weather.)\n1.

Some can be enjoyed from the comfort of a canoe, a boat or even a traditional mokoro (dug-out canoe).  \nExploring Africa on a water-based safari brings you closer to aquatic animals like hippo &amp; crocodile while superb birdwatching can be enjoyed as the sun sets over the bushveld.  Elephants are frequently spotted drinking or playing in the water – an incredible sight to see!\nNot many destinations in Africa offer water-based safaris, but the ones that do, are totally worth the visit!\nWe recommend that you combine a water safari with a land safari so that you can experience the best of both worlds.  Land-based safaris include open 4x4 game drives that will get you up, close &amp; personal with Africa’s wildest animals while water-based safaris are relaxing, memorable &amp; plenty of fun.\nGet ready &amp; dive deeper with us as we explore Africa’s best water-based safari destinations.\n1. Chobe River, Chobe National Park - Botswana\nThe Chobe River sits on the northern boundary of the famous Chobe National Park in Botswana &amp; hosts a variety of exciting water-based activities, including sunset boat cruises, game viewing cruises &amp; fishing safaris.  You can even overnight on a luxury houseboat &amp; experience the Chobe River in style.\n2. Okavango Delta – Botswana\nA water destination like no other, the iconic Okavango Delta is a water wonderland dotted with private islands, secret channels, open waters &amp; the predator-rich Moremi Game Reserve.  The Delta offers a year-round water safari experience, &amp; here you can explore the waterways of the Okavango Delta by traditional mokoro (dug-out canoe) or by boat.  Walking safaris are also popular &amp; some camps even offer fishing expeditions.  If you are travelling to Botswana, we’ll make sure to suggest the best combination of camps so that you can experience both land &amp; water-based activities.\n3. Zambezi River, Victoria Falls – Zimbabwe or Zambia\nThe majestic Victoria Falls is one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World &amp; is the longest east-flowing river in Africa.  It flows through 6 countries &amp; straddles the border of Zimbabwe &amp; Zambia.  Tumbling into the mighty Zambezi River with its many adventure activities, it comes as no surprise that Victoria Falls is known as ‘Africa’s adventure capital.’  The Zambezi River offers sunset boat cruises, canoe safaris, fishing expeditions &amp; white river rafting.\n4.

We’re not just talking about stepping onto an aeroplane, fastening your seatbelt &amp; flying across the ocean to another country…Of course, that is a given.  \nWe’re talking about floating in the sky &amp; experiencing life from a bird’s eye view.  This is the dream.  So why not dream big &amp; set off on a scenic hot air balloon safari?\nSomething magical happens when you observe the bush from a different vantage point.  The peaceful surroundings below you are filled with bright colours as the sun rises over the eastern horizon.  As the earth warms up, the wildlife starts to become active &amp; it is quite the thrill to spot animals as they move across the plains.  The balloon can fly relatively low over big herds (unlike helicopters &amp; small planes), making this one of the best ways to witness the Great Wildebeest Migration.\nFloating in a hot air balloon is a photographer’s dream.  Nothing quite compares to capturing the stillness of the bush from the sky &amp; finding inspiration from nature.  Rest assured:   Africa has it all.  From Sosussvlei’s red sand dunes to the vast plains of the Serengeti &amp; Masai Mara – life in the sky has its rewards.  \nWhen you touch down on solid earth again, scrumptious champagne breakfast awaits you, prepared &amp; served on the savannah – a wonderful ending to the perfect safari experience.  \nFly with us as we point out Africa’s most amazing hot air balloon safaris.\n1. Serengeti National Park, Tanzania\nA balloon ride over the Serengeti is one of the most iconic in all of Africa.  Known as one of the most famous national parks in the world, the Serengeti is not only home to the Great Wildebeest Migration but will also offer you plenty to see.  Keep an eye out for giraffe, elephant, buffalo &amp; impala while you soar through the sky.\n2. Sossusvlei, Namibia\nSurrounded by desert, mountains &amp; a landscape of acacia trees, Sossusvlei is one of Africa’s most scenic destinations.  As the sun rises over the desert, the colour of the sand dunes turns blood red – a welcomed surprise for photographers who are eager to take that perfect picture.  Visitors are drawn to this area for its sparse, yet beautiful landscape that is best viewed from the sky. \n3. Masai Mara, Kenya\nThe iconic Masai Mara is a magnet for travellers from around the globe &amp; known for its vast open plains - home to the Great Wildebeest Migration.  Soaring in a hot air balloon over these endless plains is often a highlight of a Masai Mara safari.  Spotting wildlife from the air as you glide above the trees is an experience you will never forget.    \n4. Kafue National Park, Zambia\nKafue is one of Africa’s premier hot air balloon safari destinations, because of its remoteness &amp; abundance of wildlife.  Get excited, because if you visit Kafue, you will have an opportunity to spot animals like hippo, buffalo, puku &amp; red lechwe from the air.\n5. Tarangire National Park, Tanzania\nKnown for its breathtaking landscape, Tarangire National Park is also home to large elephant herds – often visible from the air.  Balloon guests can also spot herds of zebra, running gazelles &amp; Verreaux Eagle Owls from the comfort of the basket.",

    "description": "GO GORILLA-TREKKING\nTalking about Bucket List adventures?  Look no further, because trekking through the jungles of Africa &amp; coming face to face with endangered mountain gorillas is as good as it gets!\nThe fact that gorillas as a species are on the verge of extinction &amp; treks are a highly restricted activity, puts gorilla-trekking on top of the list when it comes to once-in-a-lifetime travel experiences.\nThe rainforest is a challenging environment, so if you want to trek, you need to be fairly fit, in good health &amp; equipped for humid, muddy conditions.  Even in the dry season, the steep slopes &amp; thick vegetation can be challenging for some, but if you’re up for the hike, it is worth every moment.\nGorillas are susceptible to human illnesses, but don’t have our immunities – so a common cold can be fatal to a gorilla family, which means that you won’t be able to trek if you are unwell.\nYou are not allowed to use a flash when taking a picture &amp; have to wear a protective face mask when approaching the gorillas to prevent spreading viral &amp; bacterial diseases from humans to primates.\nEach group (a maximum of 6 guests) is led by a professional guide &amp; tracker that will take you into the thick of the forest, in search of a habituation gorilla family.  Once found, you’ll be able to spend an hour with the gorillas, watching the adults groom each other &amp; the babies tumble &amp; play.\nThose wishing to spend more time with the gorillas can purchase a Gorilla Habituation permit, which will allow them – along with researchers &amp; park rangers – to help train gorillas to get used to people.  Gorilla Habituation may take between 2 to 3 years to be completed, so being able to actively engage in conservation is an experience of a lifetime.\nChimp-trekking is quite different to gorilla-trekking.  Although the trekking conditions are much easier, they are wary of humans &amp; a little harder to find.  Chimps &amp; other primate species can also be seen on a gorilla-trek – but there are several other superb chimpanzee trekking destinations like Uganda’s Kibale Forest, Queen Elizabeth National Park &amp; Murchison Falls National Park or Rwanda’s Nyungwe Forest National Park.  You can also spot them in Tanzania’s Mahale Mountains National Park &amp; Gombe Stream National Park.\nIf you are coming all the way to Africa, you may as well add a gorilla safari to your itinerary.  After all, it is a once-in-a-lifetime experience that will leave you with lasting memories.\nFor the best gorilla-trekking adventure, visit one of the following African destinations.\n1. Volcanoes National Park – Rwanda\nThe beautiful Volcanoes National Park in north-western Rwanda is Rwanda’s prime rainforest &amp; home to 5 of 8 volcanoes in the Virunga Mountains range.  The park was also the base for the revolutionary primatologist, Dian Fossey, &amp; is home to a staggering amount of mountain gorillas, rare golden monkeys &amp; a variety of forest birds.  \n2. Bwindi Impenetrable National Park – Uganda\nThe mountain gorillas of Uganda can be found in Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park – a World Heritage Site of both montane &amp; lowland forest that is home to 120 species of mammals, 350 bird species &amp; 220 butterfly species.  Hosting half of the world’s population of mountain gorillas, Bwindi also offers thrilling encounters with colobus monkeys &amp; chimpanzees.",

All of which were great! \nWe appreciated the attention to detail, it removed all the guess work & uncertainty from the trip, ensuring that we relaxed and enjoyed the itinerary. We’ll definitely make use of Africa Unwind in the future!\nFrom the moment we arrived at Christiana Lodge, the owner Christine treated us like family. The rooms were beautiful, with lovely large white towels, crisp, clean linen & sublime views. We were offered various dinner options with complimentary reservations done on our behalf. The service was excellent. Depending on your family, we’d highly recommend the self -catering cottage, which provided us with ample space - especially on the few rainy days we had. \nThe highlight of each morning was breakfast. A delicious menu of which we sampled everything over the course of our holiday. Each member of the family had their favourite & there was often a debate over who should be having the pancakes…again….\nBeing walking distance to the beach was also brilliant. We enjoyed some sundowner strolls. The lodge is also really close to the Robberg Nature Reserve walk, which was one of the favourite memories of our trip. Ensure you have enough sunscreen & water. A truly remarkable walk of diversity; from sea cliffs, to dunes to beach.\nWe really felt looked after. It was a wonderful stay in a beautiful, quiet part of Plettenberg Bay. Highly recommended!\nThe Bilton Family",

    "description": "We really appreciate all of Liselle’s support during our travels – she was extremely prompt in her response times &amp; we felt that she was always accessible, especially when we urgently needed her (after a natural disaster forced us to change lodges).\nIn speaking with and comparing experiences with other travelers who were using some of the larger companies, we felt that we received a personalized &amp; top service from her. From the moment our itinerary was arranged to how she assisted us in finding substitute accommodations so quickly after a natural disaster. We were truly blown away by Lion Sands Ivory Lodge and also recognize that we likely received such a generous upgrade because of her local relationships. \nWe also appreciate Liselle being so responsive &amp; supportive while we struggled to board the flight to Mozambique (due to Covid restrictions). Though there was nothing that she could have done to influence a government restriction, we appreciate her spending so much time on the phone to clarify &amp; also knew she would have quickly assisted us in finding accomodations for that night if necessary. Luckily all worked out, &amp; we managed to board the flight to Mozambique!\nAs far as the accommodations, our personal reviews are as follows:\n1. Camissa House\nThe location &amp; views were stunning, the staff &amp; service was exceptional, &amp; the breakfasts were actually the best we had on the entire trip. We would recommend booking the terrace rooms.\n2. Ilios Tours &amp; Transfers\nOur tour company was also exceptional - we lucked out with our tour guide, Shadley, &amp; requested him for every other tour we had, including Franschhoek. We had a wonderful time on our private tours &amp; appreciated the flexibility to do exactly as we wanted.\n3. La Cle des Montagnes\nAnother exceptional property with superb service, including an unbelievable breakfast. We really appreciated being within walking distance of downtown &amp; the yards in the back were just stunning. Overall, we were blown away by Franschhoek &amp; Stellenbosch &amp; look forward to returning to this special place! One note for future foodie travelers - we do recommend dining at La Petite Colombe &amp; to reserve this for a day where you have either a late start or one more day in Franschhoek.  This way, you won’t have to get up early the next day for your onward travel arrangements to the bush.\n4. Tanda Tula Plains Camp\nThis property was very personal, warm &amp; accommodating – with very good service as well. We felt like family at this lodge. The safari rides were exceptional &amp; our tracker &amp; guides were extremely knowledgeable. The food was also very good &amp; we enjoyed the bush breakfasts. All in all, Tanda Tula felt much more personal &amp; the wildlife viewing was most exceptional. (Although Lion Sands Ivory Lodge was our favourite &amp; felt like a higher end safari lodge in comparison to Tanda Tula Plains Camp.)\n5. Lion Sands Ivory lodge\nGiven the context of how we arrived here (upgraded by Africa Unwind after a natural disaster forced us to change safari lodges), I'm not sure this would have been in our original budget. But this property was jaw dropping upon our arrival. We felt that we had truly arrived on \"honeymoon\" while staying in their Villa Suite. Though it's a large property, they managed to make our stay feel personal &amp; warm with exceptional service. The food was extremely well prepared &amp; high quality; however we preferred some of the other menu options earlier in our trip.\nAll in all, we are interested in returning to this property simply because of the rooms. And we feel it is easily accessible for other family members &amp; friends would be equally impressed with the accommodations.\n6. Azura Benguerra\nWe booked a beach villa, but upon arrival realised this specific villa needed maintenance, so we informed Liselle about it.  Once again, her service &amp; relationship equity to swiftly correct the problem was extraordinary. The upgrade we received in response was extremely generous. (Villa Amizade)  Our butler at this property was again exceptional &amp; provided a very personal experience…\nWe felt our every need was met! \nBest regards,\nElizabeth &amp; Adam",

    "description": "There are two things that excite me when it comes to travel:  Islands &amp; luxury…And for some reason, these two things are like cookies &amp; cream – they create the perfect balance to a holiday.\nSo, from now on I will refer to this term (Islands + Luxury) as ‘Island Extraordinaire’, because if you continue to read until the end, you’ll understand why our recent trip to Mozambique was exactly that - Extraordinary!\nSince I was a young girl, I dreamt about being whisked away to a romantic island retreat where my villa was right on the sand.  I have always wanted to be surrounded by turquoise blue water &amp; palm trees while eating fresh seafood on the beach…We would watch a romantic sunset, enjoy adventurous watersports &amp; get pampered at the spa…&amp; then I would wake up!\nWell, this time, my dream would become a reality! \n“Finally,” I thought.\nMy husband &amp; I were getting ready for our secluded island getaway to Mozambique’s Bazaruto Archipelago - the combined name for 6 idyllic islands which lie just off the mainland between Vilanculos &amp; Inhassoro.  We were ecstatic to be calling Benguerra Island home for the next week! \nWe have heard that this island is known for its unspoilt beauty &amp; diverse ecologies, so “excited” was probably a bit of an understatement!\nThere are only 3 luxury retreats on the entire island, &amp; we were going to stay at 2 of them.\nOK, if you are reading this - fasten your seatbelt – you are about to be blown away!!\nUpon arrival at Vilanculos Airport, we were met by a friendly staff member &amp; taken to a VIP lounge in a quite corner of the airport, where we could enjoy welcome drinks before our transfer arrived.  Shortly after, our pilot arrived &amp; escorted us to our private helicopter.  Yes, you heard right – private helicopter!  Blown away yet?\nThe 20-minute helicopter trip was simply spectacular!  Looking down at the turquoise blue ocean while spotting the odd traditional dhow boat made me feel like pinching myself.\n“Welcome to your dream island,” I thought as the helicopter came to a standstill.\nAfter a warm island greeting, the staff showed us around Benguerra Island Lodge - one of the most sought-after African island destinations – known for offering the best in laidback island luxury.  \nIt wasn’t hard to fall in love with our beach villa &amp; its beautiful surrounds.  Accommodation comprises 2 beautiful cabanas &amp; 10 slightly larger casitas that are built right on the edge of the beach, each boasting an outdoor shower, private deck with jacuzzi or plunge pool &amp; sun loungers.  \nEach casita also includes a tastefully appointed lounge area, and outdoor sala &amp; an irresistible hanging daybed…where we spent most of our time!\nThey also cater for families!  The 3-bedroom, 3-bathroom Casa Familia is the epitome of exclusivity &amp; comes with a personal chef, outdoor showers, a lounge &amp; dining room, a private wooden deck with swimming pool &amp; direct beach access.\nCommunal areas include a massage sala, dive centre, beach bar &amp; lounge.\nWe stayed in one of the casitas &amp; felt like royalty!  The private pool was such a treat &amp; a wonderful place to relax between snorkelling, beach walks &amp;…well, eating.  Tough life, right?\nOne of the things that really stood out for us, was the service.  The staff were incredible &amp; nothing was too much trouble for them!  They asked us each day where we would like to have dinner &amp; our answer was always the same: “We would love a private beach dinner please…” - because what beats eating fresh seafood while watching the sun set over the ocean…barefoot?! And each time their reply was the same: “Sir, it is no problem!” (smiling)\nSo, there we were – on our remote Indian Ocean Island – with our feet in the sand, eating to our hearts content &amp; looking out over the sea, thinking: “Can we just stay forever?”\nEvery day was pure bliss!  We decided to use this time to really switch off, relax &amp; do as little as possible…except swim, sunbath, eat, nap, read &amp; snorkel – of course!  But if you want to do more activities – you can!  Their activity list includes scuba diving, Land Rover island drives, fishing, dhow cruises, castaway picnics &amp; birdwatching.  Other options are island walks, village visits, sea kayaking, catamaran cruises &amp; horse riding…Wow, that’s a mouthful!\nSunset is such a beautiful time on the island, so we decided to round off our stay with a romantic dhow cruise around the island. (a traditional sailing boat made by locals) It was so special to be sitting in a rustic wooden boat with a local Mozambican man who grew up on the island.  It was like being transported to another – very special – world.\nAfter a few days at Benguerra Island Lodge, our open jeep transfer collected us &amp; whisked us away to our next stop:  Azura Benguerra Island – one of Mozambique’s most stylish island retreats.\nAfter a very warm welcome, we were taken to our beach villa.  “Wow!”  And then – no words...Just happiness.  Each elegant beach villa comes with a private butler, a plunge pool &amp; a romantic day sala – the perfect blend for a romantic stay.  No wonder Azura Benguerra is a favourite among honeymooners.\nThere are a variety of villas for every type of client – as well as a family villa (sleeping 5 guests) &amp; a 3-bedroom, 3-bathroom presidential villa offering the ultimate in luxury.\nThe resort operates on a fully inclusive rate, which means that all meals, drinks, butler-service &amp; a variety of activities are included in your stay.  “Which activities are included?” you may ask.  Are you ready for it…? A scenic island drive by Land Rover, a sunset cocktail of the day served to your sala, the use of snorkelling equipment as well as kayaks &amp; paddleboards, a romantic sunset dhow cruise, a try scuba diving session in the pool, the use of Peri Peri Beach Club as well as honeymoon special treats &amp; various activities for kids.\nOf course, there is a long list of other activities on offer at an additional cost.  These include reef snorkelling, island hopping, scuba diving, deep sea fishing, beach picnics &amp; spa treatments.\nIf you were wondering what a typical day at Azura looks like…Here we go!  After sleeping in, we woke up, opened our curtains &amp; looked out over the turquoise ocean.  After relaxing a bit on our beach sala (my husband with his coffee &amp; me with my orange juice), we had a lovely breakfast on the deck overlooking the ocean.  What a way to start the day!\nNext up – snorkelling!  Both of us love being in the water, so we always prioritise a snorkel safari while on holiday.  After we met our friendly skipper, we headed out on a private speed boat to explore the Indian Ocean’s beautiful coral reefs.  And what a trip it was!  Surrounded by nothing except translucent waters, sea creatures &amp; coral – with no other boats or people in sight – we came face to face with technicoloured marine life that moved in droves along the exposed coral.  “Breathtaking,” we thought!\nOur concierge at Azura recommended we do a castaway beach picnic…&amp; so we did.  On our way back, our skipper stopped at a small, private isle in the middle of the ocean, &amp; when we came closer – our mouths hung open as we looked at what was in store for us next.  A private beach picnic, packed out in style!  A canopy was set up for us - with plenty of shade, comfortable bean bags were laid out, along with fluffy towels, a cooler box full of our favourite drinks &amp; a table set up with a fresh seafood lunch.  “Sir, when would you like us to collect you again?” they asked.  We decided that 3 hours would be sufficient to enjoy all the picnic surprises, have a swim, lie in the sun &amp;…do a few handstands on our private isle!\nSo, there we were – in paradise!  With nothing &amp; nobody else in sight…except the fish!\nAfter a very relaxing time - &amp; the most delicious meal – we saw something in the distance.  Our transfer….a private catamaran!  Our skipper welcomed us with a drink &amp; even asked us: “Sir, how fast would you like to go?”  After thinking a little, my husband replied: “Let’s go fast &amp; then go slow!”  Basking in the sun on our private catamaran, we felt so relaxed &amp; totally rejuvenated.  When we approached the island, our personal butler was waiting for us on the beach – with our favourite cocktail in hand!  \nThe sun was now setting, so after relaxing on our beach sala – cocktail in hand – we decided to go stand-up paddle boarding.  (One of our other favourite island activities!)  “What a day!” we thought – in the most positive sense. \nAs we were standing on our boards, looking out over the orange skies &amp; quiet ocean, only one word came to mind: “Extraordinary!”\nThis time it was not a dream.",

    "description": "Everyone loves Cape Town.  Full stop.  This article is finished.\nThe only reason I continue to write, is because there is so much to say about South Africa’s most beautiful city.  You may think I am biased since I was born here & grew up here – but then I meet people from other countries around the world who agree with me - & I realise, I am right! (She said humbly.)\nThis is why my family & I often pretend we are tourists in our own city.  We go to the beach, we visit the penguins at Boulders Beach, we hike to the top of Table Mountain (or on lazy days – we take the cable car) & each time, we realise how fortunate we are to call this place home.\nSouth Africa’s oldest city – hence the nickname “the Mother City” offers something for everyone!  Gorgeous white-sand beaches, spectacular mountains & lush green vineyards are right on your doorstep.  And of course, there are a variety of boutique shops, museums, galleries & world-class restaurants to choose from.\nWhat makes Cape Town so unique, is that couples, honeymooners & families all want to visit.\nOne of my family’s favourite activities in Cape Town, is taking a drive to Cape Point, along the scenic Atlantic Seaboard.  On our way, we normally stop at the affluent coastal suburbs of Camps Bay, Clifton & Llandudno that lie below the Twelve Apostles Mountain range.  Nothing gets me more excited than spending time at the beach – especially in summer!\nOur next stop is normally Hout Bay, a quaint seaside village with magnificent views. And then we proceed onto Chapmans’ Peak Drive – one of the world’s most spectacular coastal drives towards the Cape of Good Hope Nature Reserve & Cape Point.\nWith towering stone cliffs, endemic fynbos, breathtaking bays & rolling green hills, Cape Point is a must on your Cape Town holiday itinerary!  This is usually where I take out my camera & force my family to pose for a million photos!  (One day, they will treasure these memories.)\nWhen my camera battery has died & the kids are ready for food & ice cream, we make our way to Simons Town for lunch & always stop at Boulders Beach with its adorable penguin colony.  Yes, the rumours are true – when visiting this gorgeous beach with turquoise blue water & white sand, you’ll be surrounded by furry little friends in their natural habitat.  Watch the African penguins swim, dive & wobble around the beach while you relax in the sun (or in my husband’s case – the shade).  \nAfter our stomachs (& hearts) are full, we normally end the day with a visit to Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens.  Set against the slopes of Table Mountain, the gardens are known around the world for its beauty & diversity of the Cape Flora it displays.  \nWhether you are exploring Cape Town at your own pace or booked a private guided tour with Africa Unwind, you will be blown away by The Mother City.\nThe sun is starting to set & we have enjoyed pretending to be tourists in our own city.  It is time to go home, but no one wants to leave…\nThe four of us agree.  We won’t.",

(Everyone needs friends like ours!)\nThe thought of getting pampered, detoxing in the steam room &amp; swimming in a heated pool got us so excited, we decided to stay the entire weekend.\nAnd the reason I am blogging about this, is because we all know how amazing (&amp; tiring) travel can be.  When booking a holiday, we spend so much time exploring the area, dining out &amp; taking pictures, that we forget about the ‘unwinding part of the trip!’ \nSo, I say: ‘Go for it!”  Treat yourself.  By all means – explore, travel &amp; repeat.  But balance it with something that relaxes you.  For me, that is massages &amp; facials!\nSo off we went…\nUpon arrival at Majeka House, a boutique hotel set in the historic town of Stellenbosch in the Cape Winelands, we checked into our room &amp; decided to spend the afternoon relaxing by the heated pool.  After sunset, we enjoyed a lovely dinner next to the fireplace – the perfect ending to a day in the Winelands.  We particularly enjoyed their healthy poke bowls – in fact – we had it twice during our stay!\nThe next morning, after a delicious breakfast served in the restaurant overlooking lush gardens, we were ready for our day of pampering!\nThe Wellness Spa at Majeka House offers a wide range of spa treatments, including the complimentary use of the heated pool, steam room, sauna &amp; Jacuzzi.\nTheir Spa Menu includes massages, facials, body wraps &amp; scrubs, hand &amp; feet treatments, waxing, nail treatments &amp; much more.  \nYou are also more than welcome to tailor your own package from their Spa Menu.\nWe decided on the Majeka Magic Package, which includes a 45 min back &amp; foot massage, a 60 min bespoke facial &amp; a lunch.  This package is tailored to couples, so we were booked into the larger treatment room with 2 massage beds.\nTheir well-trained &amp; experienced therapists were attentive to our personal needs &amp; treated us like royalty.\nAfter our pampering session, we put on white, fluffy robes &amp; enjoyed an amazing lunch in the gardens.  The rest of the day was spent reading on the pool loungers, swimming &amp; detoxing in the steam room &amp; Jacuzzi.\nWhen travelling, we enjoy staying at properties that offer spa facilities, because there is always time for a little bit of pampering.  \nMost of Africa Unwind’s clients enjoy booking private tours to Cape Town &amp; the Winelands, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t time for a relaxing treatment in the afternoon.  \nOr even better – stay an extra night &amp; get pampered properly before flying back home!\nAren’t holidays about relaxing…?  So, do that!\nCome to Africa…&amp; Unwind.",

    "description": "“Wow, I am excited about this trip!” I thought while packing.\nSafari outfits?  Check.  Camera?  Check.  Swim gear?  Check.  After I have packed these three essentials, I almost felt like the rest of the things on my list were suddenly not so important anymore.  (But with kids, you always need to pack more!  So I did.)\nWe were staying along the scenic Garden Route &amp; already experienced a bag full of family fun – ziplining through the forest, hiking, water park thrills &amp; elephant encounters – so it was time for our bush adventure!\nKariega Game Reserve is not only a malaria-free safari region (ideal for families or pregnant travellers), but is also home to the coveted Big 5 – lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo &amp; rhino.  Two rivers flow through the reserve:  the Kariega &amp; Bushman’s Rivers – attracting an abundance of wildlife &amp; offering travellers both land &amp; water-based activities. (subject to water-levels)\nWe chose this location, because it is a wonderful add-on to a self-drive Garden Route holiday – but you can also catch a quick flight from Cape Town to Port Elizabeth &amp; get transferred by road to your safari lodge.\nSo, after a short 2-hour drive from Port Elizabeth, we reached our safari home for the next few nights:  Settlers Drift, a luxury tented lodge with exceptional views.\nUpon arrival, we were met by a friendly member of staff &amp; transported to the jetty overlooking the river, where we enjoyed a welcome drink before our boat arrived.  “Yay!” we all thought as the boat approached us.  “What a grand entrance!”\nAfter a beautiful 20-minute boat ride, we met our friendly guide, Michael, &amp; then hopped onto an open 4x4 jeep that took us straight to the lodge.  On our way, we saw a wide variety of wildlife – including so many giraffes – we could hardly count them all!\nWhen we arrived at Settlers Drift, we were already relaxed!  The lodge boasts amazing décor, spectacular views, large open-plan areas, a gorgeous boma &amp; an infinity pool overlooking the vast bushveld below.\nThe staff showed us around &amp; escorted us to our tent.  (There are only 9 tents at Settlers Drift, so the experience is intimate &amp; private.)  “Wow,” we thought when we reached our room.  “Spacious, was, perhaps an understatement.”  Beautifully designed, each tent has an opulent bedroom, a living area, a full bathroom with an indoor &amp; outdoor shower, a mini bar &amp; a private deck with gorgeous views.  The tents are so spacious, our kids didn’t need their own room – but slept on their own, comfortable beds in the living area.  \nA tent ‘highlight’ for us, are the sliding glass doors in the bathroom!  They can slide open so that the large bathtub &amp; shower are completely exposed to the lush bush outside!  Indoor-outdoor magic!  \nGame drives were plenty of fun!  We saw so many animals during our afternoon &amp; morning drives, including one of my favourite elephant encounters yet!  On our second day, just before the sun set, a herd of about 30 elephants approached our vehicle. (Don’t worry, safety is always first!)  Our guide switched the engine off &amp; we sat in silence as the herd moved closer to us.  They were so close, if we were to reach out (don’t ever do this, it is not allowed) – we could have touched them!  They were super relaxed &amp; very curious.  Then we heard a few elephants trumpeting &amp; watched as some of the little ones played with one another next to our vehicle…A magical sighting, indeed!\nWe also loved the sundowner stops in the bush.  “Kids, time to stretch your legs!”  Nothing beats feeling the African bushveld underneath your feet while sipping a delicious drink &amp; watching the sun set over the horizon.\nI feel like I must pause for a moment &amp; comment about the food.  Because – let’s be honest – food is a very important part of a safari holiday.  We ate our hearts out!  Not only did the chef take our dietary requirements into consideration (we have quite the list!), he spoiled us by serving meals in different locations each day.  Lunched was often served on the deck overlooking the bush &amp; dinner was served next to a roaring fireplace or in the outdoor boma.  We also loved the breakfast spot…You have guessed it – with even more views!\nIn-between game drives, we enjoyed cooling off in the infinity pool, sunbathing or reading…&amp; of course, taking a much-needed afternoon siesta! (We are not used to those early morning wake-up calls!)  Spa treatments can also be enjoyed in the comfort of your tent.\nSettlers Drift was a wonderful option for our family, but I think an even better choice for honeymooners or couples wanting to experience a slice of bushveld paradise.\nWhen it was time to leave, we were a little devastated, to say the least.  Settlers Drift made a huge impression on me…on us.  But we will most definitely be back for another sunny safari!\nShall I start packing?",

    "title": "Wine  Whales",
    "description": "Apart from seeing the Big 5 on safari, there are 2 things that get most travellers excited:  Wine &amp; Whales – in no particular order!\nBut we are not most people.  My husband &amp; I don’t even drink wine (please don’t judge us!) – but we decided to investigate 2 of the most popular self-drive routes in South Africa to see if they are truly as spectacular as everyone says.\nNestled between sun-kissed vineyards &amp; majestic mountains, the picturesque valleys of the Wine Route (also referred to as the Cape Winelands) are renowned for their exquisite wines, grand old estates, pretty towns &amp; award-winning restaurants.\nWithin only a 60-minute drive from vibrant Cape Town, you reach one of the most breathtaking regions in South Africa where Alpine-style views, art galleries &amp; quaint side-walk cafes are seen from almost every street.\nSo off we went…\nThe Cape Winelands generally refers to the 3 most popular wine-growing regions surrounding Cape Town: Franschhoek, Stellenbosch &amp; Paarl, each countryside setting as beautiful as the next.  But we decided to go a little off-the-beaten-track to the outskirts of Wellington &amp; make Grand Dedale Country House our first stop.\nSet along a dirt road at the foot of the Bainskloof Pass on Doolhof, a working wine estate, Grand Dedale is surrounded by majestic mountains &amp; lush vineyards.\nWe were excited to see that the country house is small &amp; intimate, boasting only 6 individually styled rooms &amp; a double volume honeymoon cottage that stands quietly amid the paddocks &amp; gardens.\nOur room enjoyed gorgeous views over the pool &amp; included a private dining area where romantic dinners can be enjoyed by candlelight.\nWe quickly learned that this is the kind of property to take advantage of – there is no need to get back into a car or transfer vehicle, because everything you need is under one roof!  Not only is the cuisine out of this world – we enjoyed 4-course dinners each evening…&amp; it was incredible!  Food is important at Grand Dedale &amp; every afternoon, high tea buffets &amp; sundowner drinks are served around the pool or lounge area.  \nThey can even arrange romantic picnic baskets lunches that can be enjoyed at one of the mountain viewpoints.\nWe are normally very adventurous travellers &amp; love to do as many activities as possible, but for some or other reason, we decided that relaxation was our top priority this time around! (Perhaps it was because our twins were still babies when we visited…&amp; we thought it is best to catch up on some R&amp;R while we had the time…And all the parents say: “Yes, please!”)\nBut even if our trip seems too laid-back for you – there are plenty of things to keep you busy – without ever having to leave the property.\nOn-site outdoor activities include hiking, mountain biking, horse riding &amp; fishing.  But my personal favourite on the ‘to do’ list is relaxing spa treatments in one of the opulent suites.  Nearby, you can enjoy hot air ballooning, clay pigeon shooting &amp; quad biking.\nWine lovers will be delighted to know that they can taste the full range of Doolhof’s award-winning wines in the Tasting Room &amp; private wine cellar tours can also be arranged on request. \nEach day, we explored the farm by taking hikes up the mountain – it was wonderful to be able to connect with nature right on our doorstep!  And when we returned to the country house…it was time for a delicious alfresco lunch on the veranda, followed by a dip in the pool.  We ended off the day with sundowner drinks &amp; a romantic candlelight dinner in the comfort of our own suite.\nBut you know how they say:  When one door closes, another one opens!  Even though we were sad to leave Grand Dedale Country House, we knew our next stop would be one for the books!\nSo off we went.  \n“Welcome to Babylonstoren,” we thought to ourselves as we arrived at one of the oldest – yet most elegant &amp; simplistic - Cape Dutch farms in the country.  I leaned over to my husband &amp; said: “This is luxurious farm living at its best!”  He agreed.\nBabylonstoren is set at the foot of Simonsberg in the Franschhoek wine valley &amp; has put the farm-to-table kitchen concept on the map.  We were so excited to taste food prepared fresh from their garden!\nAfter a warm welcome, we were taken to our beautiful suite with white-washed walls, thatched roof &amp; clean, contemporary interiors.  High ceilings, white décor &amp; hand-picked furniture give the rooms a modern feel while maintaining the historical flair.\n“Happy?” my husband asked.  The answer was obvious!\nI was so excited to explore the farm &amp; see why Babylonstoren remains a favourite amongst international &amp; local travellers.  \nSo, let’s first talk about Babylonstoren’s heart &amp; soul.  The Garden.  This floral wonderland can be explored via guided tours or self-exploration.  Surrounded by lush greenery as far as the eye can see, organic fruit &amp; vegetables, a beautiful farm dam (restored reservoir) &amp; majestic mountains – we were in our element!  \nProviding an interactive farm-experience, Babylonstoren encourages guests to get involved in harvesting fruit or picking the vines.  Other exciting activities include rowing at the dam, wine tasting &amp; cellar tours, as well as hiking, swimming, fishing &amp; cycling.\nFor those travelling with kids – get ready for more fun! The little ones can feed the donkeys, collect eggs, help harvest fruit &amp; vegetables, go on scavenger hunts &amp; even assist the chef in kneading &amp; baking delicious farm bread.\nWe loved walking around the farm, exploring at our own pace &amp; enjoying everything nature has to offer.  \nOnce we explored the farm, we decided it is time to explore the food!  (And all the foodies in the world say: ‘Let’s go!’)  \nBabylonstoren boasts 3 amazing restaurants.  Babel - with its seasonal farm-to-fork philosophy &amp; unconventional flavour combinations, Greenhouse – tucked away in the garden, with its picnic-style food &amp; wood-fired breads, &amp; The Bakery – a family friendly option where guests dish up for themselves from wooden boards placed on their tables.\nI can write an entire blog post just on their food…but I won’t.  Because if I start typing, I won’t stop…\nMany people describe Babylonstoren cusine as “out of this world” – but I don’t agree.  Because the term “out of this world” means that it is so far removed from reality (on earth) that we can’t even comprehend how wonderful it really is…but the fact remains:  This food is so close to the earth, it is picked from their own garden &amp; freshly prepared…from farm to table.  So, I will rather say it is authentically outstanding.\nDuring our stay at Babylostoren, we got in touch with nature, tasted world-class food &amp; enjoyed a cosy evening by the fireplace…Not bad.  Not bad at all.\nThe next day, we sadly checked out &amp; headed to Hermanus, a quaint fishing village along the scenic Whale Route.\nHere’s a fun fact – Did you know that Hermanus offers the best land-based whale watching in the world?  Pretty amazing, right?\nEach year between July &amp; November, Southern Right whales &amp; Humpback whales migrate here to calve &amp; mate, so visitors can marvel at these gentle giants from one of the walking paths overlooking the ocean or from the comfort of a boat.\nFor the ultimate whale watching experience, avid photographers can also take to the skies for a spectacular bird’s eye view of the whales while capturing an incredible shot of mothers with their newborn calves, or large mating groups.\nBut whales are not the only reason to visit. The Whale Route has so much to offer – from majestic mountains &amp; beautiful beaches to nature reserves &amp; charming seaside towns.\nNeedless to say…we were excited!\nUpon arrival at Birkenhead House, we were blown away by the idyllic location.  Set on dramatic cliffs in Hermanus, with stunning views of Walker Bay, we knew that this opulent &amp; luxurious beachfront retreat will offer the best in elegant seaside luxury.\nAnd we were right!  \nBirkenhead House is a honeymooner’s paradise - offering breathtaking views, relaxing spa treatments, sublime cuisine, impeccable service &amp; romantic turn-downs.\nAn all-inclusive rate allows guests to indulge from morning to evening while relaxing days can be spent at one of the elegant swimming pools – one located in a beautiful courtyard &amp; the other overlooking the ocean.\nEach day, we felt like we woke up in a dream.  We strolled down to the breakfast areas overlooking the ocean, &amp; while we were eating or swimming in the infinity pool, we saw whales frolicking in the ocean.  Just below the retreat, there is a hiking path that will take you straight to the beach, or the harbour – so you can continue to walk for miles on end while enjoying some of the best land-based whale watching in the world.  (You can also rent a boat for up-close-&amp;-personal encounters!)\nI enjoyed getting massages at the spa, while my husband relaxed by the pool reading a book.  There is a word for this….Bliss!\nOther exciting nearby activities include golfing, horse-back excursions, fishing, bird watching, &amp; exploring the town of Hermanus with its many restaurants, shops &amp; markets.  Thrill-seekers can also go shark-cage diving in Gansbaai, a 30-minute drive away.\nOne of our favourite Birkenhead memories, was the food!  What is better than eating fresh seafood while overlooking the deep blue waters of the Indian Ocean? \nDays were spent relaxing in the sun, dipping in the pool, hiking, going to the beach, getting spa treatments &amp; watching the gentle giants of the sea frolicking in the bay below.\n“This is our happy place,” we thought.\nOn our way back home, my husband &amp; I were talking about our favourite travel moments – as we usually do - when we realised that this trip had too many to count.  \nThe proof is in the pudding: Wine &amp; Whales should go together. (Even if you don’t drink wine – like us!)\nThere is a reason that people from across the globe come far &amp; wide to experience our food, our scenery &amp; our wildlife.  \nThis is South Africa!  And we love it!",
