    "description": "What is a bucket list? Simply put, it is a collection of dreams & aspirations that we would like to accomplish within our lifetime.\nIt is no surprise that when it comes to travel goals, Africa is usually on top of the list. Our beautiful continent dominates all bucket list destinations because of the spectacular memories & moments it promises!\nAfrica offers its visitors a variety of experiences, including action-packed wildlife encounters, spectacular scenery, pristine beaches & exciting activities.\nWe have compiled a list of our Top 6 bucket list travel experiences, so come & journey with us as we dive deeper into Africa’s most rewarding safari ‘must-do’s.’\nLooking for bucket list travel experiences? A safari should be Number 1 on everyone’s list. Africa offers superb Big 5 game viewing, close-up wildlife encounters & dramatic nature spectacles such as the Great Wildebeest Migration – a ‘not to be missed’ activity on the safari itinerary. Adding on Victoria Falls, one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World is a great idea.\nExperiencing the real Africa from the comfort of an open-air treehouse is quite the adventure & definitely an experience of a lifetime. Sleeping under a canopy of stars while listening to the sounds of the wild is what the African Bucket List is all about.\nThere are many ways to enjoy close-up wildlife encounters. Open 4x4 game drives & guided walking safaris will take guests straight into the action while relaxing mokoro or boating safaris are the perfect way to get closer to aquatic animals such as hippo, crocodile & birds.\nHot air balloon safaris allow guests to enjoy a bird’s eye view over the scenic landscape below. Flying over the red sand dunes of Sossusvlei or the game-packed plains of the Serengeti is an experience that should not be missed.\nWhat is more magical than spending time with endangered mountain gorillas in the lush forests of Rwanda or Uganda? Hiking through dense rainforests in search of wild, habituated gorillas & chimps is a life-changing experience, to say the least. Observing these amazing creatures in their natural habitat is one you will never forget.\nThe Indian Ocean is filled with secluded islands where absolute exclusivity is the aim. Most of these islands can only be accessed by helicopter, small plane or sea transfer – which means that you will experience only the best in barefoot luxury where beach villas, private pools & white, sandy beaches await.\n\nTick off the Big 5 (& see Vic Falls)\nSleep in a treehouse under the stars\nEnjoy a water-based safari\nFloat in a hot air balloon\nGo gorilla-trekking\nStay on a private island",

    "description": "Happy kids – happy parents. This is the recipe for a successful family holiday!\nThis is where we come in. At Africa Unwind, our job is to ensure that careful planning goes into your family safari vacation or beach getaway, ensuring that you & your little ones have the time of your lives.\nFrom witnessing close-up animal encounters & sleeping in a treehouse to exciting treasure hunts & swimming with dolphins – Africa has it all!\nWant to know more?\nHere are our top 6 reasons why an African family safari or island-style getaway is your best choice:\nTravelling to Africa with your family means one thing – the best family safari holiday ever! This bucket list activity is why most visitors choose Africa as their holiday destination. And if you ever want to see true excitement on a child’s face – bring them along! Apart from experiencing family game drives while on safari, kids can also enjoy elephant-back rides, walk with penguins on the beach, have breakfast with giraffes or interact with meerkats. You can also watch baby turtles nest on a postcard-perfect island or witness whales calve from a boat.\nFamily travel can be tricky when it comes to finding the right accommodation. Private villas are often the best way to go. Whether youchoose a luxury family safari lodge, or an ocean-view suite, you’ll have everything you need for a true home-away-from-home experience & enjoy the added benefit of dedicated staff who will look after your every need.\nIn Africa, fun is around every corner. Many beach resorts & safari lodges boast dedicated Kids Clubs that offer a wide selection of fun-filled activities for your little ones. Should parents wish to enjoy a quiet dinner every so often, kids can play their hearts out at the Kids Club or alternatively, babysitting can be arranged.\nFamilies are often independent travellers who like to explore at their own pace, without being tied down to a certain schedule. That is where self-drive holidays come into play. Certain countries in Africa have great infrastructure that allows for safe & easy self-drive vacations.\nThere are many African destinations that are malaria-free – which means that you can still go on your dream family safari vacation, soak up the sun on a tropical island or enjoy adventurous activities with your kids - even while you are pregnant. We are here to recommend the best malaria-free family-friendly destinations – just ask.\nOur beautiful continent offers a long list of family-friendly activities, so rest assured that no one will get bored during an African family vacation. Whether you are coming face to face with a lion (from the comfort & safety of a safari jeep), riding on the back of an elephant, ziplining through a forest, riding on a quad bike or going on a treasure hunt – Africa will thrill the whole family!\n\nWitness fascinating animal encounters\nStay in private villas with dedicated staff\nHave fun at the Kids Club\nExplore at your own pace \nChoose malaria-free destinations\nEnjoy family-friendly activities",

    "description": "“What is a typical day on safari like?”  This is one of the first questions asked by travellers who have never been to Africa…&amp; a good one, indeed!\nThere may be slight differences based on the country you visit or the time of year you travel, but a typical safari follows a familiar rhythm that combines action-packed wildlife encounters with ample time to relax in between – the perfect blend for a dream holiday.\nUpon arrival at each safari lodge or camp, you will be informed of the day-to-day safari program, but we thought we’ll give you a taste of a quintessential day in the African bush.\n05h30 – 06h00:  Wake Up Call\nDepending on what time the sun rises, you will be woken up by a friendly knock on the door &amp; a tray of coffee, tea &amp; cookies that will get you out of bed &amp; into some warm clothes – ready for the game drive!\n06h00 – 09h00:  Morning Game Drive / Activity\nBeing out in the bush just after sunrise is simply put – magical.  Animals are at their most active during this time, so you will experience thrilling wildlife encounters from the comfort of an open 4x4 jeep.  (A dedicated guide &amp; tracker is assigned to each vehicle.)  Many animals use the early mornings to make their way to waterholes where they can quench their thirst – quite a sight to behold!\nSome countries also offer hot air balloon safaris in the early mornings.  What is more spectacular than viewing the bush from a bird’s eye view?\n09h00 – 10h00:  Breakfast\nBy mid-morning, the bush is hot.  Most animals have quenched their thirst &amp; start retreating to the shade.  You will return to the lodge for a delicious breakfast or brunch – usually served on a deck with spectacular views or in a remote bush setting.\n10h00 – 13h00:  Leisure Time (Read, Nap, Swim, Spa)\nAfter an eventful morning out in the bush, there is nothing quite like taking a hot shower &amp; spending the rest of the morning as you please.  Take a book down to the pool, go for a massage, hit the gym, or – frankly – take a nap!  Some lodges also have Kids Clubs, so the little ones can enjoy further adventures while the adults enjoy a little rest &amp; relaxation.\nMost safari lodges also offer guided walking safaris after breakfast.  If you are feeling active &amp; want to experience the bush on foot, this is your chance!  Walking safaris are a fun way to learn more about animal tracking, smaller animals &amp; plants.\n13h00 – 14h00:  Lunch\nAnd just like that – it is time to eat again!  On safari, you will be treated like royalty &amp; food is an important element that cannot be overlooked.  Most travellers admit that they put on a few pounds on safari – a good indication of an enjoyable holiday!\n14h00 – 15h30:  Leisure Time (Read, Nap, Swim, Spa)\nAfter lunch, guests have a little extra leisure time to edit their photos, enjoy the peace &amp; quiet or spend time by the pool with a book in hand.  Most lodges &amp; camps boast beautiful views over the bush, &amp; some even have views over waterholes.  This is a wonderful time to take out a pair of binoculars &amp; enjoy nature in its purest form.\n15h30 – 16h00:  High Tea\nJust before high tea, start to get ready for your afternoon game drive or activity.  Gather your camera &amp; binoculars, put in your drinks order for sundowners &amp; if it is winter, pack a scarf, gloves &amp; beanie as it gets chilly once the sun goes down.\nHigh tea is a safari tradition that was born during the unhurried days of the 19th century.  Each camp serves a scrumptious selection of nibbles – anything from cake, tart &amp; scones to savoury sandwiches &amp; traditional African bites.\n16h00 – 19h00:  Afternoon Game Drive / Activity\nThe hottest time of day is now over &amp; it is finally cool enough for the animals to become active again.  During the afternoon game drive, just before the sun sets, guests will enjoy a special safari tradition – The Safari Sundowner – where drinks &amp; snacks are served in a scenic bush setting.\nIf you are in a private concession, the game drive will continue after dark.  You will use a spotlight to look for nocturnal animals on the way back to camp.\nSome countries also offer other activities during the afternoons.  These include boating safaris, mokoro safaris in dug-out canoes, fishing &amp; hot air balloon rides.\n19h00 – 21h00:  Dinner\nAfrica stokes the appetite like nowhere else on the planet!  Being out in the fresh air gets you in the mood to fill your belly – once again.  Depending on your lodge or camp, dinner may be plated, a la carte or served buffet-style, but is usually a multi-course affair accompanied by wine.\nSome camps serve dinner in a variety of locations, so guests will have a different setting each night – alfresco on the deck, in a cosy dining room, out in the bush or in the boma - a traditional open-air area around a campfire where staff often entertain guests with traditional singing &amp; dancing.\n21h00:  Bed Time\nBelieve it or not, but by 21h00 most guests are ready for bed!  Tomorrow is a new day &amp; wake-up is early.  The bush does not wait…\n\n05h30 – 06h00:  Wake Up Call\n06h00 – 09h00:  Morning Game Drive / Activity\n09h00 – 10h00:  Breakfast \n10h00 – 13h00:  Leisure Time (Read, Nap, Swim, Spa)\n13h00 – 14h00:  Lunch\n14h00 – 15h30:  Leisure Time (Read, Nap, Swim, Spa)\n15h30 – 16h00:  High Tea\n16h00 – 19h00:  Afternoon Game Drive / Activity\n19h00 – 21h00:  Dinner",

    "description": "TICK OFF THE BIG 5 \nComing to Africa without seeing the Big 5 is like visiting Paris without catching a glimpse of the Eiffel Tower!  \nThe term ‘Big 5’ was coined by big-game hunters of the past &amp; refers to the 5 most difficult animals in Africa to hunt on foot - but is now widely used in the safari industry as some of the most interesting animals to see on a photographic safari.\nLion, leopard, elephant, buffalo &amp; rhino have become ‘celebrities of the bush’ &amp; one of the main reasons an African safari should be on everyone’s bucket list.\nThere are many places in Africa where you can see the Big 5, so journey with us as we share the best of the best.\n1. South Africa\nSouth Africa is the king of the jungle when it comes to Big 5 game reserves, &amp; this beautiful country offers something for everyone.  The best place to see the Big 5 is in Kruger’s Private Game Reserves.  Families who are looking for a malaria-free holiday should opt for Madikwe Game Reserve or one of the reserves in the Eastern Cape as these destinations offer a variety of family-friendly lodges &amp; camps.\n2. Botswana\nFor an authentic &amp; wild safari experience, you should hop on a small plane &amp; fly to the world-famous Okavango Delta, the game-packed Moremi Game Reserve &amp; the iconic Chobe National Park as these areas all offer superb Big 5 wildlife viewing.\n3. Namibia\nEtosha National Park is Nambia’s cherry on top when it comes to Big 5 game viewing.  The park is famous for its numerous waterholes, so you’ll have ample opportunity to witness animals make their way to the water to drink, splash &amp; play.\n4. Tanzania\nMost visitors to Tanzania want to see the Great Wildebeest Migration, one of Earth’s greatest wildlife spectacles.  But the country also offers superb Big 5 wildlife viewing year-round.  The best places to see the Big 5 is in the game-packed Serengeti National Park &amp; the beautiful Ngorongoro Crater.  \n5. Kenya\nThe crème de la crème of Kenya is the Masai Mara, a magnet for travellers who want to experience the Great Wildebeest Migration in season.  The Mara is also home to the famous Big 5, so guests can tick off both in one holiday.\n6. Zimbabwe\nMost travellers who want to experience a classic Big 5 safari, also want to witness one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World:  the majestic Victoria Falls.  The Falls can be seen from both Zimbabwe &amp; Zambia’s sides &amp; can easily be combined with a safari to Zimbabwe’s Big 5 regions:  Hwange National Park &amp; Mana Pools National Park.\n7.  Zambia\nAlthough Zambia is technically a Big 5 country, rhino is rare &amp; can only be seen in Victoria Falls’ Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park &amp; in North Luangwa National Park.  Lion, elephant &amp; buffalo are common across multiple parks while Kafue, South Luangwa &amp; Lower Zambezi are well-known for leopards.",

When we grow up, we sometimes forget that life is still full of fantasy, mystery &amp; fun.\nMany safari lodges throughout Africa offer guests just that – a unique &amp; magical experience…&amp; what is more magical than spending a night in a treehouse under the stars?\nEach treehouse is luxuriously set up for you, usually accompanied by a special dinner under the stars, a radio &amp; a starry sky as canopy.  Some treehouses are located in the middle of the bush (close enough to camp) while others come in the form of ‘star beds’ on your chalet’s open rooftop deck.\nStep back with us into childhood &amp; see which treehouse stay you prefer. \n(Please note that most treehouse stays are only available when booking a room at the lodge, in the event that you have to return to your room due to bad weather.)\n1.

    "description": "ENJOY A WATER-BASED SAFARI\nAfrica offers a wide range of exciting safari activities – but not all safaris take place on land!  Some can be enjoyed from the comfort of a canoe, a boat or even a traditional mokoro (dug-out canoe).  \nExploring Africa on a water-based safari brings you closer to aquatic animals like hippo &amp; crocodile while superb birdwatching can be enjoyed as the sun sets over the bushveld.  Elephants are frequently spotted drinking or playing in the water – an incredible sight to see!\nNot many destinations in Africa offer water-based safaris, but the ones that do, are totally worth the visit!\nWe recommend that you combine a water safari with a land safari so that you can experience the best of both worlds.  Land-based safaris include open 4x4 game drives that will get you up, close &amp; personal with Africa’s wildest animals while water-based safaris are relaxing, memorable &amp; plenty of fun.\nGet ready &amp; dive deeper with us as we explore Africa’s best water-based safari destinations.\n1. Chobe River, Chobe National Park - Botswana\nThe Chobe River sits on the northern boundary of the famous Chobe National Park in Botswana &amp; hosts a variety of exciting water-based activities, including sunset boat cruises, game viewing cruises &amp; fishing safaris.  You can even overnight on a luxury houseboat &amp; experience the Chobe River in style.\n2. Okavango Delta – Botswana\nA water destination like no other, the iconic Okavango Delta is a water wonderland dotted with private islands, secret channels, open waters &amp; the predator-rich Moremi Game Reserve.  The Delta offers a year-round water safari experience, &amp; here you can explore the waterways of the Okavango Delta by traditional mokoro (dug-out canoe) or by boat.  Walking safaris are also popular &amp; some camps even offer fishing expeditions.  If you are travelling to Botswana, we’ll make sure to suggest the best combination of camps so that you can experience both land &amp; water-based activities.\n3. Zambezi River, Victoria Falls – Zimbabwe or Zambia\nThe majestic Victoria Falls is one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World &amp; is the longest east-flowing river in Africa.  It flows through 6 countries &amp; straddles the border of Zimbabwe &amp; Zambia.  Tumbling into the mighty Zambezi River with its many adventure activities, it comes as no surprise that Victoria Falls is known as ‘Africa’s adventure capital.’  The Zambezi River offers sunset boat cruises, canoe safaris, fishing expeditions &amp; white river rafting.\n4. Queen Elizabeth National Park – Uganda\nUganda is a country laden with jungles, craters &amp; national parks - &amp; is one of Africa’s top gorilla &amp; chimp trekking destinations.  Fit for royals, Queen Elizabeth National Park is home to the famous tree-climbing lions &amp; 2 large bodies of water:  Lake Edward &amp; Lake George, both connected by the Kazinga Channel – home to a diversity of wildlife.  The channel is one of the park’s main features &amp; boasts the highest concentration of hippos &amp; Nile crocodiles in the world.

We’re not just talking about stepping onto an aeroplane, fastening your seatbelt &amp; flying across the ocean to another country…Of course, that is a given.  \nWe’re talking about floating in the sky &amp; experiencing life from a bird’s eye view.  This is the dream.  So why not dream big &amp; set off on a scenic hot air balloon safari?\nSomething magical happens when you observe the bush from a different vantage point.  The peaceful surroundings below you are filled with bright colours as the sun rises over the eastern horizon.  As the earth warms up, the wildlife starts to become active &amp; it is quite the thrill to spot animals as they move across the plains.  The balloon can fly relatively low over big herds (unlike helicopters &amp; small planes), making this one of the best ways to witness the Great Wildebeest Migration.\nFloating in a hot air balloon is a photographer’s dream.  Nothing quite compares to capturing the stillness of the bush from the sky &amp; finding inspiration from nature.  Rest assured:   Africa has it all.  From Sosussvlei’s red sand dunes to the vast plains of the Serengeti &amp; Masai Mara – life in the sky has its rewards.  \nWhen you touch down on solid earth again, scrumptious champagne breakfast awaits you, prepared &amp; served on the savannah – a wonderful ending to the perfect safari experience.  \nFly with us as we point out Africa’s most amazing hot air balloon safaris.\n1. Serengeti National Park, Tanzania\nA balloon ride over the Serengeti is one of the most iconic in all of Africa.  Known as one of the most famous national parks in the world, the Serengeti is not only home to the Great Wildebeest Migration but will also offer you plenty to see.  Keep an eye out for giraffe, elephant, buffalo &amp; impala while you soar through the sky.\n2. Sossusvlei, Namibia\nSurrounded by desert, mountains &amp; a landscape of acacia trees, Sossusvlei is one of Africa’s most scenic destinations.

    "description": "GO GORILLA-TREKKING\nTalking about Bucket List adventures?  Look no further, because trekking through the jungles of Africa &amp; coming face to face with endangered mountain gorillas is as good as it gets!\nThe fact that gorillas as a species are on the verge of extinction &amp; treks are a highly restricted activity, puts gorilla-trekking on top of the list when it comes to once-in-a-lifetime travel experiences.\nThe rainforest is a challenging environment, so if you want to trek, you need to be fairly fit, in good health &amp; equipped for humid, muddy conditions.  Even in the dry season, the steep slopes &amp; thick vegetation can be challenging for some, but if you’re up for the hike, it is worth every moment.\nGorillas are susceptible to human illnesses, but don’t have our immunities – so a common cold can be fatal to a gorilla family, which means that you won’t be able to trek if you are unwell.\nYou are not allowed to use a flash when taking a picture &amp; have to wear a protective face mask when approaching the gorillas to prevent spreading viral &amp; bacterial diseases from humans to primates.\nEach group (a maximum of 6 guests) is led by a professional guide &amp; tracker that will take you into the thick of the forest, in search of a habituation gorilla family.  Once found, you’ll be able to spend an hour with the gorillas, watching the adults groom each other &amp; the babies tumble &amp; play.\nThose wishing to spend more time with the gorillas can purchase a Gorilla Habituation permit, which will allow them – along with researchers &amp; park rangers – to help train gorillas to get used to people.  Gorilla Habituation may take between 2 to 3 years to be completed, so being able to actively engage in conservation is an experience of a lifetime.\nChimp-trekking is quite different to gorilla-trekking.  Although the trekking conditions are much easier, they are wary of humans &amp; a little harder to find.  Chimps &amp; other primate species can also be seen on a gorilla-trek – but there are several other superb chimpanzee trekking destinations like Uganda’s Kibale Forest, Queen Elizabeth National Park &amp; Murchison Falls National Park or Rwanda’s Nyungwe Forest National Park.  You can also spot them in Tanzania’s Mahale Mountains National Park &amp; Gombe Stream National Park.\nIf you are coming all the way to Africa, you may as well add a gorilla safari to your itinerary.  After all, it is a once-in-a-lifetime experience that will leave you with lasting memories.\nFor the best gorilla-trekking adventure, visit one of the following African destinations.\n1. Volcanoes National Park – Rwanda\nThe beautiful Volcanoes National Park in north-western Rwanda is Rwanda’s prime rainforest &amp; home to 5 of 8 volcanoes in the Virunga Mountains range.  The park was also the base for the revolutionary primatologist, Dian Fossey, &amp; is home to a staggering amount of mountain gorillas, rare golden monkeys &amp; a variety of forest birds.  \n2. Bwindi Impenetrable National Park – Uganda\nThe mountain gorillas of Uganda can be found in Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park – a World Heritage Site of both montane &amp; lowland forest that is home to 120 species of mammals, 350 bird species &amp; 220 butterfly species.  Hosting half of the world’s population of mountain gorillas, Bwindi also offers thrilling encounters with colobus monkeys &amp; chimpanzees.",

    "description": "WITNESS FASCINATING ANIMAL ENCOUNTERS\nAll children love animals, &amp; in Africa – there is a lot of love going around!  \nNot only will your family be able to tick off the Big 5 while on safari, but there are many other interesting animal encounters that will leave you n awe.\nThis is something that the whole family can enjoy, because – let’s be honest – not many of us are used to interacting with wild animals in their natural habitat.\nSo, when it comes to family travel, wildlife should be Number 1 on your travel list.  Of course, the very first thing you should do is go on safari…But your family should also experience one of our favourite child-friendly activities: ‘Meet the Animals of Africa!’\nReady for some fun &amp; excitement?  Here we go…\n1. Enjoy Elephant Encounters:  Abu Camp, Okavango Delta - Botswana\nThe elephant is one of Africa’s most iconic animals &amp; stand out from all other species while on safari.  Quite literally!  Not only do they have an impressive size, but always manage to find a way into people’s hearts.  There are many places in Africa where you can enjoy life-changing elephant interactions (with an emphasis on rescuing, rehabilitation &amp; releasing), but our favourite is Abu Camp in Botswana’s Okavango Delta.  Here, you can touch them, feed them, walk with them &amp; even sleep in the iconic Elephant Star Bed above their boma where you will be serenaded to sleep by the contented rumblings of the elephants below.  We’ll also recommend The Elephant Camp in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe &amp; Elephant Whispers or The Elephant Sanctuary in South Africa.\n2. Meet the Penguins:  Boulders Beach, Cape Town – South Africa\nWhen families travel to Cape Town, one of the first stops on the itinerary is Boulders Beach!  Not only is Boulders one of Cape Town’s most beautiful beaches, but it is the only place in the world where you can get close to African penguins.  Yes, that’s right – here they waddle past you as you bask in the sun or enjoy a leisurely picnic.  This family-friendly swimming beach is the perfect place for your family to relax.  The kids can climb over boulders, explore the rock pools, or swim in the cool, clear False Bay water.  \n3. Eat breakfast with giraffes:  Giraffe Manor, Nairobi - Kenya\nGiraffe Manor is known to offer “the most unforgettable bucket list breakfast in the world.”  This exclusive boutique hotel is set on private land in an indigenous forest in Nairobi, Kenya - &amp; is the ideal stop-over before or after an East African Safari.  One of the biggest drawcards is the resident herd of Rothchild’s giraffes who may visit morning &amp; evening, poking their long necks into the windows in the hope of a treat.  You can take pictures as they ‘interrupt’ your breakfast &amp; enjoy the laughs &amp; giggles from your little ones as they feed them.\n4. Interact with Meerkats:  Makgadikgadi Pans - Botswana\nThese small, desert-adapted mammals are found throughout the Kalahari, which covers much of Botswana.  But the best place to interact with them is in the Makgadikgadi Pans in Botswana.  We recommend staying at San Camp, Jacks’ Camp or Camp Kalahari as they offer a meerkat experience with habituated families.  Meerkats are not shy &amp; it is not uncommon for them to jump on you as you sit still, seeking a high location from which to guard.  Children love these little creatures, so get ready to take some amazing family photographs!\n5. Watch baby turtles nest:  Thonga Beach Lodge, Maputaland Coastal Reserve – South Africa\nThe Maputaland Coast in South Africa’s KwaZulu-Natal is the only remaining major nesting site in Africa where Loggerhead and Leatherback turtles still lay their eggs.  Each year, between November &amp; February your family can go turtle tracking &amp; witness these great creatures of the deep haul themselves out of the ocean to lay eggs on the shore.\n6. Witness whales calve:  Hermanus, Whale Route – South Africa\nFamous for its majestic nature &amp; impressive size, the Southern Right Whale has always been a fascination for many.  And only a 2-hour drive from the vibrant city of Cape Town in a coastal town called Hermanus, you can witness the best land-based whale watching in the world!  Each year between July &amp; November, whale-lovers arrive along the coast to witness these massive mammals give birth &amp; care for their newborn calves.  Fun for the entire family?  For sure!",

There is also bungee jumping, animal encounters, treehouse sleep-outs &amp; Kids Clubs.\nSince each lodge, camp or resort offers its own list of exciting activities, why not browse through a few of them &amp; see for yourself?

Islands\nLife is busy.  So, let’s be honest – all of us deserve some pampering every now &amp; again.  For some – pampering means strolling on white, sandy beaches with crystal clear water, while others enjoy eating fresh seafood or sipping on a cocktail while watching the sunset.  There are those who prefer lying in a hammock or getting a relaxing massage while others want to dive, snorkel &amp; explore the island through adventure activities.  Whichever way you choose to relax, an island will get you there!\n3. Cities\nWhile many people love to get away from the hustle &amp; bustle of city life while on holiday, they often realize that visiting a city in another part of the world can be just as relaxing as a safari or a beach holiday.
