<p>When it comes to spectacular scenery, Africa has it all.  Vast plains, majestic mountains, sandy deserts &amp; turquoise oceans…And it goes without saying that a honeymoon is not complete without the opportunity to soak up the scenery.One of the most important things we consider when planning a honeymoon is:  views, views &amp; more views!It is quite wonderful to wake up each morning to the site of a river, ocean, waterhole or desert in front of you.  Your private deck with sala, plunge pool, deck chairs or hammock might just be the one place where you spend most of your time, so why not go big before going home?We have compiled a list of Africa’s most beautiful destinations – so when you visit, make sure to pack a camera so that you can capture beauty in its purest form.</p>
<ol>
<li>Okavango Delta, BotswanaPicture this:  A pure river bursts out of wild highlands &amp; then meander lazily through an African wilderness.  Finally, it spills into a 6,000 square mile maze of lagoons, channels &amp; islands.  This is the Okavango Delta, Africa’s premier wildlife destination.  Viewing the Okavango Delta from the air (in a small plane) is quite spectacular. </li>
<li>Sossusvlei, NamibiaSossusvlei is one of Namibia’s top safari destinations.  Set at the heart of the Namib Naukluft National Park, the clean-lined, curving slopes rise to a remarkable 300m &amp; are – without a doubt – one of the most astonishing sights in the world.  The area boasts spectacular scenery &amp; the desert colours are simply amazing.  It has been said by safari enthusiasts that Sossusvlei is a photographer’s paradise!  Hot air balloon flights are a must when visiting.</li>
<li>Wine Route, South AfricaNestled between sun-kissed vineyards &amp; majestic mountains, the picturesque valleys of the Wine Route (also referred to as the Cape Winelands) are renowned for is exquisite wines, grand old estates, pretty towns &amp; award-winning restaurants.  A visit to the scenic Wine Route will leave you in awe.</li>
<li>MaldivesThe Maldives is comprised of 1,190 coral islands, of which 200 are inhabited &amp; only 98 are tourist resorts.  This string of idyllic islands is encircled by translucent, ever-changing waters of the Indian Ocean, offering beach-lovers the chance to discover a luxurious island retreat like no other.  As far as the eye can see, you will find a skyline of coconut palm trees, snow-white sand beaches &amp; vibrant coral reefs.   </li>
<li>SeychellesSeychelles, the combined name for 115 islands, remains one of the world’s most beautiful &amp; secluded beach destinations, offering visitors only the best in barefoot luxury.  Here, honeymooners &amp; romantics can enjoy elegant living in award-winning resorts or super stylish villas &amp; experience world-class diving &amp; snorkelling, against a backdrop of sugar-white sand &amp; crystal-clear waters.</li>
<li>Bazaruto Archipelago, MozambiqueMozambique’s remote Bazaruto Archipelago is home to some of Africa’s most beautiful &amp; unspoilt palm-fringed beaches.  Surrounded by crystal clear water, Bazaruto consists of small, private islands that offer only the best in barefoot luxury.</li>
<li>Skeleton Coast, NamibiaNow a graveyard for shipwrecked sailors whose vessels fell victim to the Atlantic’s treacherous currents, shifting sandbanks &amp; thick fog, the Skeleton Coast is one of Namibia’s most remote regions, but also one that offers a ‘ship full’ of surprises.  This untouched stretch of coastline is home to spectacular scenery that includes sweeping vistas of desert, ocean &amp; sky.  </li>
<li>Victoria Falls, ZimbabweNo one has ever wondered why Victoria Falls is listed as one of the only Seven Natural Wonders of the World.  The local people call it Mosi-oa-Tunya, “The smoke that thunders,” because something magnificent happens when the river is high &amp; the spray towers in the air while water gushes down like falling thunder.  Visitors travel from all around the globe to catch a glimpse of this spectacular sighting.</li>
<li>Cape Town, South AfricaNestled between the Indian &amp; Atlantic Oceans with iconic Table Mountain as backdrop, lies one of the world’s most vibrant &amp; breathtaking cities.  Not only is this beautiful city home to Table Mountain - one of the 7 Natural Wonders of the World, but also boast spectacular white, sandy beaches &amp; lush vineyards.</li>
<li>Ngorongoro Crater, TanzaniaThe Ngorongoro Crater is an ancient volcanic caldera in northern Tanzania that offers some of East Africa’s easiest &amp; most rewarding game viewing.  The scenery is spectacular, predators are abundant &amp; it is not uncommon to spot the Big 5 in a single day.  Luxurious cliff-top lodges are perched right on the rim of the Ngorongoro Crater, offering some of the best views in Africa, it not the world.  </li>
<li>Serengeti National Park, TanzaniaHome to the iconic Great Wildebeest Migration, the Serengeti not only offers one of the largest concentrations of wildlife in the world but is home to the coveted Big 5 – lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo &amp; rhino, &amp; delivers sensational game viewing year-round.  Tanzania’s flagship conservation area consists of vast rolling grasslands &amp; golden savannahs, offering safari-goers a sense of space, along with some of the best game viewing in Africa.</li>
<li>Masai Mara, KenyaOne of the world’s greatest wildlife spectacles can be seen on the vast, open plains of the Masai Mara.  Each year between August &amp; November, the Mara is a welcomed pit stop for endless masses of wildebeest, zebra &amp; gazelle that follow the rains on their death-defying, 2,900km circular journey.  Talk about soaking up the scenery?  This will do it!</li>
<li>Lake MalawiWhen you stare out over the palm-fringed sandy beach with crystal-clear water, it is easy to think you are on an oceanic tropical island rather than the shores of Lake Malawi – one of the world’s largest freshwater lakes.  </li>
<li>Panorama Route, South AfricaThe Panorama Route is one of South Africa’s hidden gems &amp; a destination that you should not travel to without a camera!  Just a stone’s throw away from the world-renowned Kruger Park, this breathtaking region consists of dramatic landscapes as far as the eye can see.  Unspoilt mountains, majestic waterfalls &amp; interesting canyons are just some of the natural wonders you will encounter on a Panorama Route holiday.</li>
