it all.  Vast plains, majestic mountains, sandy deserts &amp; turquoise oceans…And it goes without saying that a honeymoon is not complete without the opportunity to soak up the scenery.</p>
<p>One of the most important things we consider when planning a honeymoon is:  views, views &amp; more views!  </p>
<p>It is quite wonderful to wake up each morning to the site of a river, ocean, waterhole or desert in front of you.  Your private deck with sala, plunge pool, deck chairs or hammock might just be the one place where you spend most of your time, so why not go big before going home?</p>
<p>We have compiled a list of Africa’s most beautiful destinations – so when you visit, make sure to pack a camera so that you can capture beauty in its purest form.</p>
<h4>1. Okavango Delta, Botswana</h4>
<p>Picture this:  A pure river bursts out of wild highlands &amp; then meander lazily through an African wilderness.  Finally, it spills into a 6,000 square mile maze of lagoons, channels &amp; islands.  This is the Okavango Delta, Africa’s premier wildlife destination.  Viewing the Okavango Delta from the air (in a small plane) is quite spectacular.</p>
<h4>2. Sossusvlei, Namibia</h4>
<p>Sossusvlei is one of Namibia’s top safari destinations.  Set at the heart of the Namib Naukluft National Park, the clean-lined, curving slopes rise to a remarkable 300m &amp; are – without a doubt – one of the most astonishing sights in the world.  The area boasts spectacular scenery &amp; the desert colours are simply amazing.  It has been said by safari enthusiasts that Sossusvlei is a photographer’s paradise!  Hot air balloon flights are a must when visiting.</p>
<h4>3. Wine Route, South Africa</h4>
<p>Nestled between sun-kissed vineyards &amp; majestic mountains, the picturesque valleys of the Wine Route (also referred to as the Cape Winelands) are renowned for is exquisite wines, grand old estates, pretty towns &amp; award-winning restaurants.  A visit to the scenic Wine Route will leave you in awe.</p>
<h4>4. Maldives</h4>
<p>The Maldives is comprised of 1,190 coral islands, of which 200 are inhabited &amp; only 98 are tourist resorts.  This string of idyllic islands is encircled by translucent, ever-changing waters of the Indian Ocean, offering beach-lovers the chance to discover a luxurious island retreat like no other.  As far as the eye can see, you will find a skyline of coconut palm trees, snow-white sand beaches &amp; vibrant coral reefs.</p>
<h4>5. Seychelles</h4>
<p>Seychelles, the combined name for 115 islands, remains one of the world’s most beautiful &amp; secluded beach destinations, offering visitors only the best in barefoot luxury.  Here, honeymooners &amp; romantics can enjoy elegant living in award-winning resorts or super stylish villas &amp; experience world-class diving &amp; snorkelling, against a backdrop of sugar-white sand &amp; crystal-clear waters.</p>
<h4>6. Bazaruto Archipelago, Mozambique</h4>
<p>Mozambique’s remote Bazaruto Archipelago is home to some of Africa’s most beautiful &amp; unspoilt palm-fringed beaches.  Surrounded by crystal clear water, Bazaruto consists of small, private islands that offer only the best in barefoot luxury.</p>
<h4>7. Skeleton Coast, Namibia</h4>
<p>Now a graveyard for shipwrecked sailors whose vessels fell victim to the Atlantic’s treacherous currents, shifting sandbanks &amp; thick fog, the Skeleton Coast is one of Namibia’s most remote regions, but also one that offers a ‘ship full’ of surprises.  This untouched stretch of coastline is home to spectacular scenery that includes sweeping vistas of desert, ocean &amp; sky.</p>
<h4>8. Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe</h4>
<p>No one has ever wondered why Victoria Falls is listed as one of the only Seven Natural Wonders of the World.  The local people call it Mosi-oa-Tunya, “The smoke that thunders,” because something magnificent happens when the river is high &amp; the spray towers in the air while water gushes down like falling thunder.  Visitors travel from all around the globe to catch a glimpse of this spectacular sighting.</p>
<h4>9. Cape Town, South Africa</h4>
<p>Nestled between the Indian &amp; Atlantic Oceans with iconic Table Mountain as backdrop, lies one of the world’s most vibrant &amp; breathtaking cities.  Not only is this beautiful city home to Table Mountain - one of the 7 Natural Wonders of the World, but also boast spectacular white, sandy beaches &amp; lush vineyards.</p>
<h4>10. Ngorongoro Crater, Tanzania</h4>
<p>The Ngorongoro Crater is an ancient volcanic caldera in northern Tanzania that offers some of East Africa’s easiest &amp; most rewarding game viewing.  The scenery is spectacular, predators are abundant &amp; it is not uncommon to spot the Big 5 in a single day.  Luxurious cliff-top lodges are perched right on the rim of the Ngorongoro Crater, offering some of the best views in Africa, it not the world.</p>
<h4>11. Serengeti National Park, Tanzania</h4>
<p>Home to the iconic Great Wildebeest Migration, the Serengeti not only offers one of the largest concentrations of wildlife in the world but is home to the coveted Big 5 – lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo &amp; rhino, &amp; delivers sensational game viewing year-round.  Tanzania’s flagship conservation area consists of vast rolling grasslands &amp; golden savannahs, offering safari-goers a sense of space, along with some of the best game viewing in Africa.</p>
<h4>12. Masai Mara, Kenya</h4>
<p>One of the world’s greatest wildlife spectacles can be seen on the vast, open plains of the Masai Mara.  Each year between August &amp; November, the Mara is a welcomed pit stop for endless masses of wildebeest, zebra &amp; gazelle that follow the rains on their death-defying, 2,900km circular journey.  Talk about soaking up the scenery?  This will do it!</p>
<h4>13. Lake Malawi</h4>
<p>When you stare out over the palm-fringed sandy beach with crystal-clear water, it is easy to think you are on an oceanic tropical island rather than the shores of Lake Malawi – one of the world’s largest freshwater lakes.</p>
<h4>14. Panorama Route, South Africa</h4>
<p>The Panorama Route is one of South Africa’s hidden gems &amp; a destination that you should not travel to without a camera!  Just a stone’s throw away from the world-renowned Kruger Park, this breathtaking region consists of dramatic landscapes as far as the eye can see.  Unspoilt mountains, majestic waterfalls &amp; interesting canyons are just some of the natural wonders you will encounter on a Panorama Route holiday.</p>

Diving is excellent year-round, but for crystal-clear conditions &amp;amp; visibility up to 30 meters – travel between April &amp;amp; May or October &amp;amp; November. 
Between May &amp;amp; October, some beaches on the southern coasts of Mahe &amp;amp; Praslin are affected by seasonal trade winds that wash up seaweed onto the beaches – although a seaweed-free beach is never far away.

Once a graveyard for ill-fated sailors whose vessels succumbed to the Atlantic&#x27;s treacherous currents, ever-shifting sandbanks, and thick fog, the Skeleton Coast now stands as one of Namibia&#x27;s most remote and captivating regions, promising surprises at every turn.
This untouched coastline unfolds with spectacular vistas that seamlessly blend desert, ocean, &amp;amp sky.

During the breeding season, between November &amp;amp December, the shores welcome as many as 200,000 seals. It&#x27;s also a prime time to witness predators like the brown hyena &amp;amp black-backed jackal seizing opportunities in this dynamic ecosystem.

The Skeleton Coast is a treasure trove of unique and thrilling safari activities.

The local people call it Mosi-oa-Tunya, “The smoke that thunders,” because something magnificent happens when the river is high  &amp;amp; the spray towers in the air while water gushes down like falling thunder.
The Victoria Falls is 1,708 meters wide  &amp;amp; with an average of 550,000 cubic meters of water plummeting over the edge every minute, it is by far the largest curtain of water in the world. Visitors travel from all around the globe to catch a glimpse of this spectacular sighting.
The Victoria Falls is set between Zimbabwe &amp;amp; Zambia, making it accessible to view from both sides (visa obtained upon arrival). Guests can also easily combine a Victoria Falls adventure with a safari to Hwange, Mana Pools or Botswana for a well-rounded African holiday. Inquire with us to find out all you need to know before going to Victoria Falls and the surrounding attractions, we can plan out the perfect itinerary for adventure and relaxation!

Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe is also known as Africa’s adventure capital  &amp;amp; offers something for every type of traveler. Highlights include scenic helicopter flights, sunset boat cruises on the Zambezi River  &amp;amp; guided tours to the majestic Victoria Falls.
Adrenaline junkies tend to fill up their days with action-packed activities such as river rafting, bungee jumping, micro-lighting  &amp;amp; canoeing. There is also fun for the whole family. Elephant-back safaris are usually an all-time favorite amongst little adventurers.
If you are feeling adventurous, why not go for a swim at the edge of The Falls? (season dependent) Devil’s Pool at Livingstone Island has a good reputation &amp;amp; never fails to impress thrill-seekers or Insta-lovers.

If you’re planning a trip to Victoria Falls, the best time to visit is during ‘High Water’ season - from February to July, directly after the region&#x27;s summer rains, when you&#x27;ll see the world&#x27;s largest sheet of falling water flowing at its greatest volume.
‘Low Water’ runs between August &amp;amp; January &amp;amp;is at its lowest between November &amp;amp; early December. This is the time when there is very little spray, but river rafting &amp;amp;swimming at Devil’s Pool are both wonderful activities to experience during low season.

Throughout the year, expect extraordinary wildlife encounters, including the exhilarating predator-prey drama of calving season (February to March).

Serengeti National Park offers a wide array of wildlife-centered activities, including open 4x4 game drives, guided walks, captivating hot air balloon safaris, &amp;amp rewarding birdwatching. Cultural visits, delightful picnic lunches, invigorating mountain biking, &amp;amp horse riding are among the other thrilling pursuits available.

For optimal wildlife viewing, plan your visit during the dry season from late June to October. This period not only offers superb wildlife encounters but also showcases the pinnacle of the Wildebeest Migration. While wildlife viewing is excellent year-round, specific areas shine during different times. Keep in mind that the entire migration is orchestrated by rainfall. Here&#x27;s a brief overview:
JANUARY: Herds move south to the area near Lake Ndutu.
FEBRUARY &amp;  MARCH: Calving season unfolds, with thousands of wildebeest calves born daily.
APRIL &amp; MAY: Herds move northwest toward the Moru &amp; Simba Kopjes.
JUNE: They reach the central Serengeti, preparing for the challenging journey ahead.
JULY: The herds arrive in the Grumeti region, confronting the crocodile-infested waters of the Mara River.
AUGUST: Witness thrilling river crossings from the northern Serengeti to the Masai Mara.
SEPTEMBER: Herds break into smaller groups, with most crossing to the Masai Mara while a portion remains in the northern Serengeti.
OCTOBER: In October, the best time for wildlife viewing is in the Masai Mara in Kenya. Opt to stay in one of the less-crowded private conservancies where off-road driving &amp; night drives are permitted.
NOVEMBER: Normally, the short rains begin in November - tempting the wildebeest to leave the dry Mara for the rejuvenated Serengeti. Generally, they can be seen in the Serengeti’s northeastern region where they may split into smaller groups before continuing their journey southward.
DECEMBER: In December, the herds move south towards fresh grazing &amp; cover the northern &amp; eastern Serengeti in preparation for another action-packed 3,000 km journey.</span></p><div class="Cards_fadeOut__iJbVq"></div></div></a></div><div class="Cards_card__wYVf4 Cards_coverimgmain__65A74"><a class="Cards_link__2bKVP" href="/safaris/kenya/masai-mara"><div class="Cards_cardImage__RUe2O Cards_coverimg__j8N2f"><img alt="MASAI MARA" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" class="Cards_img__TlfQc" style="position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;object-fit:cover;color:transparent" src="/optimized-images/default.webp"/></div><div class="Cards_h2class__syS9G">MASAI MARA</div><div class="Cards_descr__gRO23"><p><span>The Masai Mara National Reserve &amp;amp its neighboring conservancies form Kenya&#x27;s flagship conservation area &amp;amp are undoubtedly one of Africa&#x27;s top safari destinations.
The vast, open plains of the Mara attract an abundance of wildlife, including elephants, buffalos, zebras, giraffes, hyenas, &amp;amp the Mara&#x27;s iconic big cats: lions, leopards, &amp;amp cheetahs.
One of the world&#x27;s greatest wildlife spectacles unfolds here each year between August &amp;amp November. It&#x27;s when the Mara becomes a vital pit stop for the endless masses of wildebeests, zebras, &amp;amp gazelles embarking on their death-defying, 2,900-kilometer circular journey following the rains.
But before these resilient herds can reach the Mara&#x27;s lush grazing grounds from Tanzania&#x27;s Serengeti National Park, they must confront the dramatic, crocodile-infested rivers—a sight to behold in its own right.
For those seeking close encounters with Africa&#x27;s predators and big game, staying in a private conservancy that permits off-road driving &amp;amp night drives is essential.

The heart of the Masai Mara experience lies in open 4x4 game drives &amp;amp walking safaris guided by Maasai warriors. These game drives take you right into the heart of the action, ensuring intimate encounters with Africa&#x27;s wildlife. Expert local guides lead both morning &amp;amp afternoon game drives.
Some lodges also offer night drives with spotlights, allowing you to focus on elusive nocturnal animals. Another highlight is exploring the bush from a bird&#x27;s-eye view in a hot air balloon. After the flight, you&#x27;ll enjoy a champagne breakfast—an ideal start to a morning in the Mara.

The Masai Mara offers superb year-round wildlife viewing, so there&#x27;s no single &#x27;best time to go&#x27; for general game viewing. High season (June to October) brings cooler, drier weather &amp;amp more crowds, while low season (November to March) offers warmer, wetter conditions &amp;amp fewer visitors. During the low season, there are more baby animals to see, &amp;amp birding is excellent.
However, the absolute best time to witness the world-famous Wildebeest Migration is usually between August &amp;amp November, depending on rainfall patterns. The Mara&#x27;s resident animals give birth between December &amp;amp January during calving season.
MIGRATION EXPLAINED
JANUARY
In January, the herds move south from the northeast region to the area near Lake Ndutu.
FEBRUARY &amp;amp MARCH
February to March is calving season when over 8,000 wildebeest babies are born each day, offering the chance to witness the bittersweet interaction between fierce predators &amp;amp wobbly calves.
APRIL &amp;amp MAY
Between April &amp;amp May, the herds generally move northwest towards the Moru &amp;amp Simba Kopjes. Breeding is now in full swing, &amp;amp by May, the calves are stronger, allowing the herds to move a bit quicker into the central Serengeti.
JUNE
In June, they are typically in the central Serengeti, preparing for the most challenging part of their journey. Some herds may have split up, with a few already crossing the Grumeti River.
JULY
July sees them reach the Grumeti region and northern parts of the Serengeti, facing their greatest obstacle yet: the crocodile-infested waters of the Mara River.
AUGUST
August is usually the best time to witness the river crossings from the northern Serengeti to the Masai Mara.
SEPTEMBER
In September, the herds break into smaller groups, with most crossing over to the Masai Mara, while some (less than half) remain in the northern Serengeti.
OCTOBER
In October, the best chance to see them is still in the Masai Mara. Opt to stay in one of the less-crowded private conservancies that permit off-road driving &amp;amp night drives.
NOVEMBER
Typically, the short rains begin in November, tempting the wildebeests to leave the dry Mara for the rejuvenated Serengeti. You can usually spot them in the Serengeti&#x27;s northeastern region, where they may split into smaller groups before continuing their southward journey.
DECEMBER
In December, the herds move south toward fresh grazing, covering the northern &amp;amp eastern Serengeti in preparation for another action-packed 3,000-kilometre journey.

Covering 30,000 square km &amp;amp taking up a large slice of Malawi, this freshwater body is home to the largest number of fish species in the world, making this an ideal destination for water sport enthusiasts.
Here, in what people call ‘the friendliest country in Africa,’ guests can enjoy freshwater snorkelling, scuba diving, kayaking, sailing &amp;amp fishing.
Accommodation is mostly found around the lake’s southern &amp;amp central regions, but even in the more visited areas, the lake remains wonderfully untouched by mass tourism. Beautiful lakeside chalets range from family-friendly beach resorts to romantic island lodges.
Lake Malawi is an ideal choice for guests who are looking for an off-the-beaten-track beach-style holiday where beautiful scenery, adventure activities &amp;amp friendly service are of utmost importance.

Lake Malawi activities are mostly water-based. It has one of the most diverse ecosystems in the world with over 500 species of Cichlids. It is because of this abundant aquatic life, that Lake Malawi has some of the most diverse dive sites in the world.
Other popular activities include snorkelling, kayaking, sailing, boating &amp;amp fishing.

The best time to visit Lake Malawi is during the drier winter months, between May to late October when days are warm &amp;amp sunny – great for beach weather!
The hot summer rains fall between November to April.</span></p><div class="Cards_fadeOut__iJbVq"></div></div></a></div><div class="Cards_card__wYVf4 Cards_coverimgmain__65A74"><a class="Cards_link__2bKVP" href="/cities/panorama-route"><div class="Cards_cardImage__RUe2O Cards_coverimg__j8N2f"><img alt="PANORAMA ROUTE" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" class="Cards_img__TlfQc" style="position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;object-fit:cover;color:transparent" src="/optimized-images/default.webp"/></div><div class="Cards_h2class__syS9G">PANORAMA ROUTE</div><div class="Cards_descr__gRO23"><p><span>There’s plenty of things to do on the Panorama Route which is one of South Africa’s hidden gems &amp; a destination that you should not travel to without a camera!
Just a stone’s throw away from the world-renowned Kruger Park, this breathtaking region consists of dramatic landscapes as far as the eye can see. Unspoilt mountains, majestic waterfalls &amp; interesting canyons are just some of the natural wonders and scenic spots on the Panorama Route. 
The road conditions are easy &amp; safe, so independent-minded self-drive guests will love exploring the Panorama Route at their own pace. Alternatively, a private guide can also take you to some of the region’s best sites, such as God’s Window, Three Rondavels viewpoint, Bourke’s Luck Potholes &amp; Blyde River Canyon.
The Panorama Route’s charming little towns consists of Hazyview with its wide selection of outdoor activities, White River with its boutique shops, open-air restaurants &amp; golf courses, Dullstroom where fly-fishing, hiking &amp; horse-riding are at their best &amp; Pilgrim’s Rest – the Panorama Route’s historic gold mining town set in a pretty location.

The Panorama Route offers a wide selection of activities &amp; attractions. Scenic tours are usually first on the list, so guests can experience some of the area’s most beautiful sites, including waterfalls, canyons &amp; quaint towns.
Elephant interactions at Hazyview’s Elephant Whispers Centre is a bucket list experience that should not be missed. Other exciting activities include zip lining, golf &amp; game drives.

The Panorama Route is beautiful in any season, but the most rewarding time to take a trip is in the cooler, dryer months between May &amp; September – which also coincides with Kruger Park’s best safari season. The driving conditions during this time of year will be better and the views clearer.</span></p><div class="Cards_fadeOut__iJbVq"></div></div></a></div></div></div></div></div><div id="cardBread"

Ngorongoro Crater offers an exceptional safari adventure with its unique setting \u0026amp a remarkable population of 30,000 animals, making it a dream destination for safari enthusiasts.\nThe landscape is nothing short of spectacular, teeming with abundant predators. It's not uncommon to spot all members of the Big 5 in a single day here.\nLuxurious lodges situated atop cliffs on the rim of Ngorongoro Crater provide some of the world's most breathtaking views. Staying near the rim also has the added perk of being first in line for the descent to the crater floor each morning, allowing you to beat the crowds.\nFor travelers seeking more budget-friendly yet equally peaceful safari accommodations, the nearby town of Karatu, about 20 km south of the crater in the lush hills of the Karatu Highlands, offers excellent options.

Its year-round sensational game viewing is unparalleled.\nThis flagship Tanzanian conservation area encompasses vast rolling grasslands \u0026amp golden savannahs, providing visitors with a profound sense of space \u0026amp some of Africa's finest game encounters. Wildlife enthusiasts flock to the Serengeti to witness nature's grand spectacle: The Great Wildebeest Migration. Every year, millions of wildebeest, zebras, \u0026amp gazelles follow a migratory path across the Serengeti in search of greener pastures. Observing massive herds braving crocodile-infested rivers \u0026amp eluding hungry predators like Africa's big cats is the essence of the Serengeti experience.\nThroughout the year, expect extraordinary wildlife encounters, including the exhilarating predator-prey drama of calving season (February to March).\n\nSerengeti National Park offers a wide array of wildlife-centered activities, including open 4x4 game drives, guided walks, captivating hot air balloon safaris, \u0026amp rewarding birdwatching. Cultural visits, delightful picnic lunches, invigorating mountain biking, \u0026amp horse riding are among the other thrilling pursuits available.\n\nFor optimal wildlife viewing, plan your visit during the dry season from late June to October. This period not only offers superb wildlife encounters but also showcases the pinnacle of the Wildebeest Migration. While wildlife viewing is excellent year-round, specific areas shine during different times. Keep in mind that the entire migration is orchestrated by rainfall. Here's a brief overview:\nJANUARY: Herds move south to the area near Lake Ndutu.\nFEBRUARY \u0026  MARCH: Calving season unfolds, with thousands of wildebeest calves born daily.\nAPRIL \u0026 MAY: Herds move northwest toward the Moru \u0026 Simba Kopjes.\nJUNE: They reach the central Serengeti, preparing for the challenging journey ahead.\nJULY: The herds arrive in the Grumeti region, confronting the crocodile-infested waters of the Mara River.\nAUGUST: Witness thrilling river crossings from the northern Serengeti to the Masai Mara.\nSEPTEMBER: Herds break into smaller groups, with most crossing to the Masai Mara while a portion remains in the northern Serengeti.\nOCTOBER: In October, the best time for wildlife viewing is in the Masai Mara in Kenya. Opt to stay in one of the less-crowded private conservancies where off-road driving \u0026 night drives are permitted.\nNOVEMBER: Normally, the short rains begin in November - tempting the wildebeest to leave the dry Mara for the rejuvenated Serengeti. Generally, they can be seen in the Serengeti’s northeastern region where they may split into smaller groups before continuing their journey southward.\nDECEMBER: In December, the herds move south towards fresh grazing \u0026 cover the northern \u0026 eastern Serengeti in preparation for another action-packed 3,000 km journey.","image":"optimized-images/default.webp","folderName":"safaris/tanzania/serengeti-national-park","created":null},{"title":"MASAI MARA","description":"The Masai Mara National Reserve \u0026amp its neighboring conservancies form Kenya's flagship conservation area \u0026amp are undoubtedly one of Africa's top safari destinations.\nThe vast, open plains of the Mara attract an abundance of wildlife, including elephants, buffalos, zebras, giraffes, hyenas, \u0026amp the Mara's iconic big cats: lions, leopards, \u0026amp cheetahs.\nOne of the world's greatest wildlife spectacles unfolds here each year between August \u0026amp November. It's when the Mara becomes a vital pit stop for the endless masses of wildebeests, zebras, \u0026amp gazelles embarking on their death-defying, 2,900-kilometer circular journey following the rains.\nBut before these resilient herds can reach the Mara's lush grazing grounds from Tanzania's Serengeti National Park, they must confront the dramatic, crocodile-infested rivers—a sight to behold in its own right.\nFor those seeking close encounters with Africa's predators and big game, staying in a private conservancy that permits off-road driving \u0026amp night drives is essential.\n\nThe heart of the Masai Mara experience lies in open 4x4 game drives \u0026amp walking safaris guided by Maasai warriors. These game drives take you right into the heart of the action, ensuring intimate encounters with Africa's wildlife. Expert local guides lead both morning \u0026amp afternoon game drives.\nSome lodges also offer night drives with spotlights, allowing you to focus on elusive nocturnal animals. Another highlight is exploring the bush from a bird's-eye view in a hot air balloon. After the flight, you'll enjoy a champagne breakfast—an ideal start to a morning in the Mara.\n\nThe Masai Mara offers superb year-round wildlife viewing, so there's no single 'best time to go' for general game viewing. High season (June to October) brings cooler, drier weather \u0026amp more crowds, while low season (November to March) offers warmer, wetter conditions \u0026amp fewer visitors. During the low season, there are more baby animals to see, \u0026amp birding is excellent.\nHowever, the absolute best time to witness the world-famous Wildebeest Migration is usually between August \u0026amp November, depending on rainfall patterns. The Mara's resident animals give birth between December \u0026amp January during calving season.\nMIGRATION EXPLAINED\nJANUARY\nIn January, the herds move south from the northeast region to the area near Lake Ndutu.\nFEBRUARY \u0026amp MARCH\nFebruary to March is calving season when over 8,000 wildebeest babies are born each day, offering the chance to witness the bittersweet interaction between fierce predators \u0026amp wobbly calves.\nAPRIL \u0026amp MAY\nBetween April \u0026amp May, the herds generally move northwest towards the Moru \u0026amp Simba Kopjes.
